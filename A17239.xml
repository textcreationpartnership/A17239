         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ Vnto the right honorable, Henry, <hi>Earle of Huntingdon, Knight of the moſt noble</hi> order of the Garter: L. Preſident of her Ma. Counſell in <hi>the North parts eſtabliſhed; and Lieutenant Generall</hi> of her Ma. people, and forces there.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſufficiently knowne to vs all, that of late yeeres the Lord hath diuerſly exerciſed vs, vnder his gentle chaſticing hand. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing touched vs before in our cattle &amp; corn; and, that more is, in certaine daungerous, ſtraunge, and vnnaturall practices againſt our Soueraign, tending to the ouerthrowe of vs all: now of late he hath threatned vs with hoſtilitie and forrein inuaſion, and with the worſt, that a proud, an idolatrous, and an inſolent people is able to do. Wherein although hee hath not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs cleane, but in the middeſt of thoſe threatnings, hath hitherto vſed great mercie towardes vs, yet do we our ſelues plainly perceiue, that as yet he hath not left off calling vpon vs, but ſtill doth put vs in mind of our wayes, as otherwiſe alſo, ſo especially by hostilitie now, and by the continuance of our enimies malice againſt vs. Jn which caſe ſo long as we ſtand, it is needefull we take good heede to theſe two thinges: that the cauſe be right wherein wee ſtand, and that we our ſelues do take it in hand in ſuch ſort as we ought to doe, The equitie of the cauſe both is now, and euer hath beene ſo plaine in it ſelfe (ſeeing that it is for the Ghospels ſake, that ſo they bende themſelues againſt vs) that when of late I entred into a deeper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe callings of God, and thought it needefull to ſet foorth ſomewhat concerning the ſame: yet notwithſtanding J then
<pb facs="tcp:13150:3"/> thought it needeleſſe to beſtow any labor in beating out that which was plaine ynough in it ſelfe, and rather choſe to imploy my pen in the other, to ſhew in what ſort this good cauſe of ours ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand of vs. Whereupon I did then ſet foorth an admonition out of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> the better to gather vs neerer to God, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the ſcarcitie wherewith at that time wee were ſomething touched: a text that then did, not onely in reſpect of that ſcarcitie, but otherwiſe alſo, and yet doth fitly agree to theſe preſent dayes, and out of which we might take to our ſelues, both then and now, inſtruction and comfort in plentifull meaſure.</p>
            <p>Since which time I haue often marked, that what by our enimies themſelues, &amp; by their fauourites that are among vs, and what by the weakneſſe of diuers of vs likewiſe, there is ſuch a deſperate fear conceiued of many, that they are vtterly void of any good hope, that theſe our troubles may be ouerblowne, or at any time ſorted to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous end. For the enimie (we ſee, and often haue founde) whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer by his owne ſtrength or our looſeneſſe he doth hope to preuail, is then paſſing full of preſumptuous boaſting and reſolute threates. Their fauourites alſo doe as redily then get holde thereof, and helpe them forward the beſt that they can: euer blowing ſuch terrors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and, for the moſt part, encreaſing them alſo, &amp; euer caſting, whereſoeuer they come, great perils themſelues. And when they are foiled, and haue gotten the worſe, and finde that God in thoſe their attempts is flatly against them: yet doe they not thereupon leaue of and turne vnto him: but euer continue their former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and buſilie repayre their forces againe. Among vs likewiſe as there be ſome, that by ſuch occaſions drawe neerer to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that our ſinnes deſerue, that we ſhould be cleane cut off, doe neuertheleſſe, in the goodneſſe of the cauſe, and the mercies of God, conceiue good hope: ſo are there others, that refuſing the comfort that thoſe groundworkes do yeelde, do ſo much relie on the iuſt deſert of our ſinnes, and the ſeueritie of God againſt it, or being of a timerous nature, are ſtroken with ſuch feare by the enimies threates and continuall malice, and by the great perils that their confederates do caſt at home, that they haue left them no hope at all, but verily thinke that in the end all will be naught.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore already done my endeuour, by my former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition out of <hi>Joel</hi> to ſtir vs vp to a ſenſible feeling of thoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:13150:3"/> callings of God, &amp; vnfeignedly to turne vnto him: I haue nowe thought good, out of ſome one text or other for to declare what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the faithfull may iustly conceiue, out of the nature of the cauſe that we haue in hand, being as it is, for the goſpels ſake, that we are ſo much maligned. For which matter I haue made choice of that part of the hiſtorie of <hi>David,</hi> that ſheweth how he, being annointed of God to the kingdom, neuertheles could not come vnto it, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough many perils, &amp; with much buſines before. But although hee were kept out for a ſeaſon, and had many lets (for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) caſt in the way: yet in the end he came to the crown, and had it confirmed vnto himſelfe and his line for euer. Jn which ſtorie we may ſee, as it were in a table, both what croſſes we muſt looke for to be caſt in the way of the goſpel now: &amp; how notwithſtanding it ſhall preuail in the end against them all. And as it was the godleſſe and looſe gouernment of <hi>Saul,</hi> that gaue that occaſion of remouing that ſame, and of the bringing in of the godlier regiment of <hi>David:</hi> euen ſo, in the late days of ignorance, the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of moſt of our princes hath bine ſuch, ſo far ſhort of that which it ſhould, as that it ought to be leſſe maruel to any, if now it the be pleaſure of God to aduance the goſpel (the ſcepter of the ſonne of <hi>David</hi>) to reforme whatſoeuer before was decayed. Which ſtorie lieth in the latter part of the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> &amp; in the beginning of the ſecond: for which cauſe alſo (ſeeing that it lieth altogether within this compaſſe) therefore haue I but ſeldome ſet down in my quotations the name of the Book, but the chapters, &amp; verſes only. And ſeing that it goeth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter only (wheras there are many other ſtories &amp; places of ſcripture beſides, that would yeeld the ſelf ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort) therfore haue J thoght <hi>The Coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of David,</hi> to be the meeteſt name for the treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuch as it is, if it pleaſe your honour to accept in good part, I thought it my duetie, for to offer the ſame vnto you, For beeing of this mind, that as I wiſh the benefit therof vnto al, ſo notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding J ſpeciall, wiſh it to the people here, ſuch as belong to your Ho. Liuetenancie (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I alſo, in diuers good reſpects, am moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) in al theſe parts I was not able to find any one, that was more exerciſed in theſe affairs: or to whom my ſelf (in al humble duety) was more beholding, or vnder whoſe protection I could rather wiſh the ſame to come foorth. Which although I had finiſhed and ſent vp to the print before, to haue come foorth the last terme, before the
<pb facs="tcp:13150:4"/> attempt of this late forrein inuaſion: yet, by reaſon that (vpon ſome priuate reſpect) a ſmall occaſion was taken by ſuch as ſhould print it, to require my further aduice in one speciall point, the long vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath come betwixt, hath eaſily brought to paſſe, that it could not come foorth till now. In which mean time, the daunger of the forrein inuaſion (God be thanked) is grown to be litle, and the feare thereof with vs much leſſe. But yet notwithſtanding, neither is that daunger clene remoued, neither may we looke for any other, but that ſtill they will bee doing with vs, if they may get vs at the aduantage: and, beſides that, we may in this one attempt of theirs (being ſo much broken as alreadie, and but hitherto it is) ſee ſome part of that trueth, that out of the Scripture is in this Treatiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto vs. Which things beeing conſidered, although nowe it come foorth ſomewhat with the lateſt in ſome respect: yet in others J doe not doubt, but that it may, and will bee thought, nowe alſo to come foorth fitly ynough.</p>
            <p>J graunt, it were to be wiſhed rather, that neither now, nor at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time elſe, there neede to be any vſe of this, or of any ſuch like, but the cauſes remaining, the effect alſo muſt needes continue. Our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will bee enimies ſtill: the ſeede of the ſerpent will euer lye in waite, for to annoy the ſeede of the woman. Though now they bee foiled, and often haue beene (yea, and though they had bene cleane ouerthrowne): yet notwithſtanding they will not giue ouer, but caſt about it againe for ſome other aduantage, and redily take it, whenſoeuer it falleth into their handes, ſo long as they are not yet ſubdued vnto the obedience of the Goſpell, but remaine enimies ſtil, there is nothing els to be looked for of them, but that on al occaſions they will be readie to exerciſe, whatſoeuer enmitie they are able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. We alſo on the other ſide, haue many thinges among vs that ſhould be amended, which we are not diſpoſed to amend, nor ſo much, as to heare of them neither. Hauing found the ſpoile of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Churches in our late Monaſteries and Chaunteries (as apparant dens of theeues, as euer were any) wee are not therewith contented. Thoſe that are left we ſuffer their Patrons (if they bee greedie, and wilie withall) to abuſe at their pleaſure. Whereby God is robed of his glory, and the people of their ſaluation. We ſuffer alſo mercileſſe men, daily more and more to eate vp the pore: to diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fermings, and townes, and to take in all to them ſelues. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:13150:4"/> there were no more but theſe thinges onely (which in deede I take to bee the greateſt): yet were they ſufficient, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo ſtrongly to cry to the Lorde for vengeance, as that it may be no maruell vnto vs, if the Lord do still raiſe vp enimies against vs. If needes wee will ſpoyle the Lordes houſes heere, and his people withall, both of his word, and of their owne liuings, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, nor grow to amendment: the more that we doe ſuch thinges our ſelues, the leſſe may we maruel if the Lord ſend in enimies to do the like, and to be auenged on the Lords behalfe, of that which we mean not to amend.</p>
            <p>Being therfore ſo likelie a matter as it is, that ſome heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are growing againſt the vngodlie that are among vs, (and ſo conſequently much buſineſſe to al, one with another indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently) and being ſo certaine, that the Lord is euer wont to exerciſe thoſe that are his, it cannot bee but to needefull purpoſe, that this kind of argument ſhould be debated: that ſo the godly may ſee what ſecuritie is layd vp for them, and others likewiſe may know of that refuge, whenſoeuer they are diſpoſed to vſe it, and turn to the Lord. And ſo now hauing ſayd, what J thought moſt needeful, to expreſſe the cauſe &amp; generall end of the Treatiſe enſuing, J am not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Honour any further at this preſent: moſte humblie beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Lord of his goodneſſe, that as nowe alreadie theſe many yeres he hath beſtowed great bleſſings on theſe parts by your godly, milde, and prudent gouernment, ſo it may pleaſe him long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your L. among vs, and to encreaſe all his graces and mercies towardes you in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

Inſomuch that as in the lake <hi>Genazereth</hi> the wind and the ſea did both together ſeeme to conſpire agaynſt that Bark, wherein Chriſt was with his diſciples, for to haue drenſhed and drowned them al; the wind ſtirring vp and rayſing the ſea, the ſea getting vp and growing rageous, and both together furiouſly beating with al their might on that ſeely veſſel: euen ſo now alſo, euer ſynce it pleaſed the Lord to vouchſafe vs the Ghoſpel agayn in ſo plentiful maner, al the powers and ſtates of the world haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bent themſelues agaynſt it, thoſe that are eſpecially led by the ſpirit of error, and haue a mouth giuen them to ſpeake proud things, ſtirring vp both Princes and their people agaynſt the truth; thoſe Princes likewiſe, and their people with them, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly taking that quarel in hand, and both together, with might and mayn ruſhing vpon the word of life, and earneſtly labouring (al that they may) cleane to ſuppreſſe and extinguiſh the ſame. Which whoſoeuer doth with aduiſement conſider, he in reaſon might eaſily be in daunger to think, both that there were ſome ſpecial great cauſe in this profeſſion, why it ſhould be ſo much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13150:8"/> maligned; and that, ere long, needs muſt it be deſtroyed alſo. Howbeit the truth is, that neyther is there in it any cauſe at al, why they ſhould ſo rage agaynſt it: neyther ſhall any, nor al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in ſuch ſort preuayle agaynſt it, when they haue done al that they can. Neuertheleſſe it cannot be denied, but that there are of the weaker ſort, that can hardly conceaue ſo good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the inuinciblenes of the cauſe it ſelf: and others agayn ſo much preſuming of the goodnes of the cauſe, that they regard not much, what careleſnes or iniquity of theirs they mingle withal; and hope notwithſtanding that al ſhalbe wel, laying al on the goodnes of the cauſe. For which cauſe I think it a work not vnworthy the labour, and very meete for the preſent tyme, that ſuch as are the Lords watchmen commend vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſuch places of Scripture as beſt may ſerue, both to deſcribe and to lay forth theſe matters vnto them, and withal to teach them, what ſhalbe the yſſue therof in the end, and how to behaue themſelues therein.<note place="margin">An example of the like, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. <hi>Ruffin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. <hi>Socr. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp; Sozom. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> And ſo may we read in auncient tyme, as of many others, ſo namely of <hi>Cyril</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that when the like occaſion was offered vnto him, he alſo tooke the ſelf ſame courſe. The like occaſion that was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, was a great fear that many of the people of God in thoſe parts conceaued, that Chriſtian religion hauing alredy bene receaued and planted there by publike authoritie, ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giue place to Iudaiſme agayn. For <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour, himſelf profeſſing the faith at the firſt, and finding the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy eſtabliſhed by publike authoritie (fourty yeres before that he came to the Crown, by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> his ſonne) and hauing a ſecret intent with him to ſet vp heathniſh idolatrie agayn, among other practiſes that he vſed to croſſe the faith of Chriſt, and thoſe that did profeſſe it, ſo much as he could, gaue libertie, comfort, and ayd vnto the <hi>Iewes</hi> to build vp the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> agayn, and there to ſacrifice, and obſerue the law as before they were wont. Whereupon great multitudes of the <hi>Iewes</hi> aſſembled themſelues together out of al quarters; ſet in hand with their buſines in great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; prepared things needful for the building in great pentie, had (in a brauerie) many of their working inſtruments of ſiluer,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13150:8"/> euen to their baſkets, ſpades, and mattokes; before hand threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Chriſtians there, how néere they would ſit vnto them ere long: and in al things had held ſuch a courſe therein for the time, as that it ſeemed vnto many, that the faith of Chriſt ſhould be aboliſhed there, and Iudaiſm ſet vp agayn. But <hi>Cyril</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, perceauing what offence this might breed vnto many, and that diuers were not a litle diſmayed thereat (and therfore much weakened in the faith thereby) calling to mind what things <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and Chriſt himſelf before had ſpoken of the vtter ouerthrow of that Temple and citie, did reſolutely ſet down vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, euen when the matter was at the higheſt, and their new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in greateſt likelihood to go forward, that yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſhould not proſper, but go back agayn, and come to no proofe in the end. And ſo it came to paſſe immediatly after. For the lime and the ſand they had gotten together in great heapes, was with mightie winds ſo blown away, that they knew not where to finde it: the old foundation, when they had taken the rubble from it, and now were redy (the next day after) to haue begun their new building theron, was in the night by a ſtraunge and mightie earthquake ſo clene turned vp and ſhaken in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that there was not left one ſtone vpon an other, that was not ſhaken out of his place: &amp; as for the timber and ſtone which they had prouided (and that in great quantitie) and their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or tooles wherewithal they ſhould haue wrought, (and many of the people themſelues) they were deſtroyed by fier, ſuch as the Lord in extraordinarie maner caſt vpon them. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cyril</hi> at that time was able, out of the Scriptures to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſound comfort to the people of God, agaynſt that diſcomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſe of theirs; and, as he was able, accordingly did it: ſo the godly in theſe dayes alſo haue (in great plenty) wherewithal to comfort thoſe that are weake, and that in their weaknes doubt very much whereunto theſe broyles may grow. For now alſo theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> of ours haue obteyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comfort and ayd of certeyn <hi>Iulians,</hi> that they hope ere long to baniſh the Ghoſpel, and to ſet vp Poperie agayne: they haue alſo contriued, and complotted their matters ſo, that nothing they hope, ſhal fruſtrate their vayn preſumption therin. But he that dwelleth in the heauens doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13150:9"/> laugh them to ſcorne: the Lord will haue them in deriſion. Let the Lords watchmen but looke about them, and they ſhalbe able to finde (and that in very plentifull meaſure) wherwithal ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to comfort, and fully to eſtabliſh the hearts of thoſe, that in their weakeneſſe ſo readilie feare, that when tyrants begin to threaten, and make preparation to do ſome miſchief, then is the Goſpell not like to eſcape it, and the power of darkneſſe (that of late ouerwhelmed the face of the earth) like to preuayle agaynſt vs agayne. To the which end, as I wiſh thoſe that can rightly do it, diligently to beate out this poynt of doctrine to the people of God: ſo my ſelf alſo haue thought good to take in hand ſome ſuch argument at this preſent, and among ſo many places of Scripture that yéeld for this matter moſt ſingular comfort, to deliuer ſome one to the inſtruction and comfort of thoſe, that in theſe dayes of ours do in ſuch ſort need to be called vpon. For which cauſe I haue made choyce of that part of the ſtorie of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> wherein we haue ſet foorth vnto vs, how, being ordeyned to be King ouer <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was kept backe, and notably exerciſed for a time, and yet notwithſtanding fully poſſeſſed thereof in the end. For ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> was a figure of Chriſt, and ſuch as was the eſtate of Chriſt here on the earth, ſuch alſo muſt be the ſtate of the Goſpell whenſoeuer the ſame is ſent vnto vs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt it needes follow, that as in that part of <hi>Davids</hi> hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wee may ſee a liuely deſcription of thoſe matters in Chriſt, both how he was kept backe for the time, and how in the end he was aduaunced; ſo may we likewiſe therein behold the eſtate of the Goſpell in theſe our dayes, for both thoſe matters: that is, how great reſiſtance for a time it findeth among vs; and how notwithſtanding it is moſt ſure to preuayle in the end. The text therefore being ſo pregnant, and ſo effectuall to ſuch a purpoſe, that I likewiſe may the better finde out (in ſome good meaſure) whatſoeuer doth belong therunto, I humbly beſeech that ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to vouchſafe me that mercie, that I may ſo do it, as may ſoundly tend, both to the aduancement of his eternall and only trueth, and to the comfort of all thoſe that vnfeignedly loue and embrace the ſame.</p>

            <p n="2">2 And ſo being purpoſed (by the goodnes, and grace of God) in ſuch ſort to vnfold that part of the ſtorie of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What comfort we have, in that which is alreadie done on behalfe of the Goſpell.</note> as that our ſelues may now alſo the better ſée, what to thinke of thoſe broiles that now are for the Ghoſpels ſake, and how we are to demeane our ſelues in the meane ſeaſon, it ſhalbe good firſt to conſider how far-forth we are holpen forward to good aſſurance by the accord that we find in that which is alreadie done héere among vs, with that which in this hiſtorie of <hi>David</hi> we find to haue bin done before: and then to aduiſe our ſelues further, of the hope that we may conceiue, of the full accompliſhment of it, for the time to come. The good aſſurance whereunto we are holpen by the accord that we find, in that which is alreadie done among vs, with that which in this hiſtorie of <hi>David</hi> we find to haue bin done before, wil beſt appeare, if we ſhall firſt ſet downe the chiefe and principall parts of the hiſtorie it ſelf: and then lay vnto it, from point to point, ſuch things as we find in theſe our dayes to agree thereunto. The chiefe and principall points of the Storie it ſelfe, are two: how it pleaſed God to bring him foorth to be in a readines for that matter: and afterward, how he brought him vnto it. That it pleaſed God firſt to bring him foorth to be in a readines for that matter, may ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, firſt by the maner that he vſed to make the matter known to <hi>David</hi> himſelfe: and then, for that he did ſo effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to others. Vnto himſelfe he made it knowne, for that by the miniſterie of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, he did annoint him thereunto. In which his Annointing we are firſt to conſider,<note place="margin">The Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of David vnto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> how it ſtandeth with a certaine Propheticall direction that was giuen forth long before: and then of certaine other things which to that preſent time apperteined. That Propheticall direction that I now ſpeake of, was giuen forth by <hi>Jaakob</hi> himſelf on his deathbed, among other bleſſings of his, to his children: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 49.8, 10.</note> that the chiefe gouernment ſhould be in the tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Whereas therfore <hi>Iſhai</hi> the father of <hi>David</hi> was of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> which had the promis, it is ſo much the more likely that ſome one might be taken thence, vnto whome the Kingdome ſhould be eſtabliſhed: then of the family of <hi>Kiſh</hi> the father of <hi>Saul,</hi> being of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> vnto whome no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13150:10"/> was made. Inſomuch that whereas it had pleaſed God, now for a time to call <hi>Saul</hi> vnto the kingdom, it may ſéeme that it was no more, but to make a readier way vnto the other that was to ſtand: and therewithal to ſet downe a patterne vnto all Princes that were to follow. A readier way might be made thereby vnto the other that was to ſtand, both for that thereby they ſhould now be inured to ſome obedience: and for that they were woont to obey, not only a meane man by parentage, and of the leaſt tribe among them all: but alſo in ſuch hard caſes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as wilful regiment is wont to yeeld. A patterne likewiſe may therein be left to all Princes whatſoeuer, to take good heed to their maner of gouernment, when as they may ſee, with what ſeueritie the Lord did puniſh thoſe two faults in the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in whom there were many good things otherwiſe found: that ſo they may the better vnderſtand, that although God doth put vp many greater matters at their hands ſince for a time; yet may they before hand ſee, how they are like to be dealt withall, when the day of vengeance ſhall come, vnleſſe they prouide for it before. Thoſe other things which to that preſent time apperteined, are two, his outward annointing, and the inward grace that was giuen withall.<note place="margin">1. Sam.</note> In his outward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing we are to conſider, that it was but<note n="b" place="margin">16.1.5.13.</note> priuatly done, in the houſe of <hi>Iſhai</hi> (or at the moſt, but only in that one towne, which was but little in reſpect of the whole people) and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a ſufficient teſtimonie vnto himſelfe, and to thoſe that knewe it: and that both his father<note n="c" place="margin">16.10.11.</note> left out him, in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet alſo<note n="d" place="margin">16.6.</note> could well haue ſetled his choice in one of the other. The inward grace that was giuen withall, was the<note n="e" place="margin">16.13.</note> Spirit of the Lord which then came vpon him, and wherewith, from that day forward, he was endewed. How effectually God did commend him to others, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appeare,<note place="margin">How benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall David was made, both to the King, and to the people.</note> for that ſhortly after he wrought forth of him ſome ſpeciall benefit vnto others: and in others likewiſe a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour to him againe. The benefit that it pleaſed God to worke forth of him vnto others, did partly reſpect <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf: and partly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> That which reſpecteth <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe was, that<note n="f" place="margin">16.23.</note> by his inſtrument he ſometimes eaſed the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13150:10"/> Kings mind, when by the euill ſpirit of the Lord, he was vexed with his melancholy paſſions. That which reſpected the whole hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> generally, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlaughter of <hi>Goliath.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, to the end that the benefit, that it pleaſed God to worke forth of <hi>David</hi> in that action, vnto them all generally, may better appeare, it ſhalbe good, more ſpecially to conſider, both how ſore an enemie that <hi>Goliath</hi> was vnto them: and how notably <hi>David</hi> deliuered them from him. How ſore an enemie he was vnto them, may ſoone appeare, whether we conſider, what terror might iuſtly proceede from him to the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> or whether we regard the great feare that they had of him. The terror that might iuſtly proceede from him to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, doth partly ariſe out of the conſideration of himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: but chiefly of him and his companie together. He alone was not only of<note n="g" place="margin">17.4.</note> extraordinarie ſtature, and ſtrength (farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding the ordinarie proportion of others) and<note n="h" place="margin">17.5.7.</note> furniſhed with armour, and weapon accordingly: but alſo, both a naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to the people of God, and to their religion; and ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in himſelfe and his companie, that he<note n="i" place="margin">17.10.45.</note> defied the hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and God himſelfe. His companie alſo might well be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both becauſe that they alſo were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall enemies, both to themſelues, and to the truth that they profeſſed: and ſometimes before had the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſtrong ſubiection. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo afraid of him, that<note n="k" place="margin">17.11.24.</note> they did not only feare to encounter him: but alſo ſhrank aſide at his preſence for verie feare. How notably <hi>David</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people from theſe their enemies, may likewiſe appeare, not only in that which he did, but alſo in the maner of doing it. That which he did, was, that he deſtroyed<note n="l" place="margin">17.49.51.</note> that outgrowne monſter <hi>Goliath:</hi> and therewithall ſtroke ſuch a terror into the hearts of all the other <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> that forthwith<note n="m" place="margin">17.51.</note> they turned their backs, and fled. His maner of doing the ſame was notable, both for vndertaking the attempt at the firſt, and afterward in the performance of it. In his vndertaking of it at the firſt, we are to conſider, how ſtrong temptation he had againſt it: and whereby notwithſtanding he conceiued vndoubted hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. The temptation that he had ſo ſtrong againſt it, was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13150:11"/> partly in <hi>Eliab</hi> his eldeſt brother, and partly in <hi>Saul</hi> the King himſelfe. In his brother <hi>Eliab</hi> he found<note n="n" place="margin">17.28.</note> himſelfe reuiled and diſdained in plentifull meaſure, only for that he did ſo much as talke of the matter: in <hi>Saul</hi> likewiſe<note n="o" place="margin">17.33.</note> his attempt condemned, as altogether impoſſible, for him to bring to any good proofe. The thing whereby he ſtrengthned himſelf againſt theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was an inuincible faith<note n="p" place="margin">17.34.37.</note> vpon the experience of Gods goodnes towards him, in two ſuch like attempts before. In his performance of it we ſée likewiſe, that he notably behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both in his preparation towards it: and in the execution it ſelfe, when he came vnto it. In his preparation we ſee, that he<note n="q" place="margin">17.39.</note> refuſed <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, and all the ordinarie furniture of war, and tooke vnto him but only his<note n="r" place="margin">17.40.</note> Sling, and a fewe ſtones for the ſame. In the execution it ſelfe we plainly ſee, that firſt he did notably<note n="ſ" place="margin">17.45.47.</note> rebuke the inſolencie and pride of that mighty Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and then though he had no other weapon but only his Sling, yet did he<note n="t" place="margin">17.48.</note> haſten with maruelous courage to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him.<note place="margin">What favour it pleaſed God to worke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid againe.</note> That ſpeciall fauour that it pleaſed God to worke forth in others to him againe, was partly found in the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that redounded to <hi>Saul</hi> alone: but much better in this that redounded to all. In his firſt benefit that redounded to <hi>Saul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we find thus much, both that he did<note n="u" place="margin">16.21.</note> loue him verie well, &amp; gaue therewithall good tokens of it: one, that he<note n="x" place="margin">16.21.</note> made him his harnes-bearer, the other, that he<note n="y" place="margin">16.22.</note> ſent to his father to haue him ſtill (though<note n="z" place="margin">17.15.55.</note> as it ſeemeth, <hi>David</hi> taried not long there.) In his latter that redounded to all, we find that God procured him fauour, both with certaine ſpeciall perſons, and with the whole multitude alſo. Thoſe ſpeciall perſons were, <hi>Saul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and two of his children. In <hi>Saul</hi> we find, that<note n="a" place="margin">18.2.</note> now he would ſuffer him to returne no more vnto his father: and that<note n="b" place="margin">18.5.</note> both he vſed him in diuers of his affaires, and ſet him ouer his men of war. Thoſe two children of <hi>Saul,</hi> in whoſe hearts God had wrought forth a fauour to <hi>Dauid,</hi> were <hi>Jonathan</hi> his ſon, and <hi>Michal</hi> his daughter. In <hi>Jonathan</hi> was wrought a verie ſingular and rare good will: inſomuch that he is<note n="c" place="margin">18.1.3.</note> ſaid, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loue <hi>David</hi> as his owne ſoule, but alſo to haue expreſſed the ſame by notable tokens. One was, that he<note n="d" place="margin">18.3.</note> made a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13150:11"/> with him; and that of loue: the other, that he<note n="e" place="margin">18.4.</note> tooke from his owne bodie, and beſtowed on him, both abiliments of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and furniture to the field likewiſe. In <hi>Michal</hi> likewiſe was wrought ſuch good will, that both at the firſt ſhe<note n="f" place="margin">18.20.</note> loued him, as one whom ſhe would be glad to make her huſband (that ſo wheras <hi>Saul</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">17.25.</note> before had promiſed to giue one of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in mariage to him that ſhould ſlay <hi>Goliath,</hi> now he might the better performe it, and <hi>David</hi> might thereby haue a readier way to that whereunto God had called him a little before) and<note n="h" place="margin">19.11.12.</note> after ſaued his life likewiſe. In the multitude we alſo finde, not only that they thought very well of him for this his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but alſo that they did the like of his other behauiour beſides, in ſuch things as were now at the firſt commended vnto him. For this is his victorie<note n="i" place="margin">18.6.7.</note> they do not only welcome him home in very good manner, out of all their cities, and with their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuments of muſick: but alſo<note n="k" place="margin">18.7.</note> rightly apportion the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, yeelding to <hi>Saul,</hi> the ordinary power, the prayſe of one thouſand; but vnto <hi>David,</hi> or to the extraordinary goodnes of God, no leſſe than ten thouſand. And as for his other beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour likewiſe, in all ſuch things wherein it pleaſed <hi>Saul</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him,<note n="l" place="margin">18.5.</note> it is alſo recorded, that he was accepted, or highly e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed in the ſight of all the people: and, that is more, euen in the ſight of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Whether the Lord haue in like ſort dealt in theſe dayes of ours, is now to bee ſeene: that is,<note place="margin">That ſuch a like thing is in theſe dayes done, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Goſpell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</note> whether in ſuch ſort he hath brought in any <hi>David</hi> (vpon the want that is found in others) as that by the nature and courſe of his dealing therein, we may hope to ſee the ſame <hi>David,</hi> to be by him not only aduaunced, but eſtabliſhed alſo for euer. Concerning which it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, that in theſe dayes alſo he hath begun to aduance ſuch a <hi>David,</hi> and ſo fitly agreeing to the patterne that is here ſet downe, as that wee may vpon good ground looke to ſee the full accompliſhment thereof in his good time. For whereas Chriſt and his Goſpell can in no wiſe bee parted, and ſeeing that the Goſpell is the ſcepter of his kingdome here on earth, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wiſedome and power of God we finde in the manner of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> aduancement, looke by what right wee may tranſlate the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13150:12"/> ſame from <hi>David</hi> vnto the perſon of Chriſt, as from the figure vnto the trueth, by as good right may wee tranſlate it vnto the Goſpell likewiſe, the only Scepter of his kingdome on earth. Firſt therefore néedes muſt it alſo be ſo inſeperably annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gouernment that was promiſed to the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that by vertue of the promiſe made vnto it, wee may looke for the accompliſhment in this likewiſe. And it may be, that for that cauſe eſpecially God hath for ſo long a time (in the late power of darkneſſe) inured Chriſtendome vnto ſo baſe and hard a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment (much worſe then was that ſame of <hi>Saules</hi>) that ſo the lawfull, and moſt bleſſed regiment of the Goſpel (otherwiſe irkſome to fleſh and blood) might be more welcome, not only to the children of God, but euen to the common multitude alſo. It may be alſo, that ſeeing that Princes haue gouerned ſo ill, as for the moſt part they haue al done (few of them ſo tollerably as did King <hi>Saul</hi>) therefore the Lord doth now begin to aduance the Goſpell, that ſo thoſe godleſſe and careles Princes may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſee what their gouernment was, that now by the Goſpell they finde to bee ſo playnlie called vnto the checke, and in many things ſo ſharply reprooued, and ſo flatly condemned likewiſe. For it is meete, that if the caſting away of <hi>Saul</hi> will not ſerue to bee a warning vnto them, then that they, and their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo ſhould be remooued, ſo farre as is néedfull, that they be no hinderance to the Goſpell of Chriſt.<note place="margin">In what ſort it is annoynted.</note> In the outward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting, that the Goſpell hath had in theſe dayes of ours, though wee denie not but great fault is found: yet in effect is it none other, but ſuch as was in <hi>Davids</hi> alſo. For if they ſay, that the Goſpell (with vs) was not at the firſt receiued by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conſent of all: no more was it at the beginning in the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; neither had <hi>David</hi> at the firſt any ſuch annoynting. If they ſay, that the wiſer and greater ſort made but little reckoning of it, and had better liking to their owne profeſſion: yet therein alſo they alleage nothing els, but the ſame that before we did ſee, to be the portion of <hi>David</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And ſeeing that the Goſpell now, hath the inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the ſpirit in ſo plentifull meaſure (for that now alſo the blind do ſee, the deaffe do heare, the lame do go, the ſicke are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13150:12"/> the dead are rayſed, and ſuch like; and the ſame, not only in particular perſons, and ſeuerall congregations, but in whole States, and diuers mightie Kingdomes likewiſe) ſuch petite quarels about the outward annoynting, can be no great matter, when as the outward is by the inward ſo throughly confirmed. But to make it more out of doubt, may we not ſee (if wee looke well about vs) that God hath made a way to the Goſpell, euen as before he did vnto <hi>David?</hi> And though his wiſedome and power be infinite, and ſo he were able to deuiſe and vſe many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes whatſoeuer: yet may we not ſee, that he hath done it in the ſelf ſame maner, that he vſed for <hi>David</hi> before; that ſo by the former, we might the ſooner acknowledg his hand in the latter? For firſt we may ſee,<note place="margin">How benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is made vnto divers. Firſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting our troubled mindes.</note> that by the Goſpell hee hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed great benefits on many: and namely ſuch, as it pleaſed him by the hands of <hi>David</hi> to beſtowe vpon others.

And doth hee not much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the troubled and deſperate conſcience of man with that ſpirituall and heauenly muſik, which by his Goſpell hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto vs: and by that notable Harmony that is betwixt the old Teſtament, and the new, in thoſe great mercies of God towards all beléeuers now, aſwell as to the Patriarkes &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before, and by the vertue of that Communion, wherby he hath coupled all the Saints together in one? And in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or meaſure ſoeuer the euill ſpirit departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> and gaue him ſome reſpit, whenſoeuer <hi>David</hi> played on his Harpe vnto him: ſure wee are, that when as now the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> playeth on his inſtrument vnto vs by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wee haue not only a great refreſhing in our inward man, but alſo are cleane rid of many euill ſpirits that before did much moleſt vs. The ſeruants of <hi>Saul</hi> taking his maladie to be but naturall, thought of no other helpe but naturall alſo: yet did it pleaſe the goodnes of God, to bleſſe the naturall helpe that they ſought, with ſupernatural operation. So now likewiſe, though many that know not their owne eſtate, giue eare to the Goſpell but only in ſome earthly reſpects: yet thoſe alſo oftimes are vouchſafed an extraordinarie and ſpeciall bleſſing thereby, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13150:13"/> with euerlaſting peace.<note place="margin">Then in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of certeyne of our Philiſtims, and of their Goliah withall.</note> As for the other benefite of <hi>David,</hi> that belonged to the whole hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Goliath,</hi> and conſequently of the whole armie of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> beſides, that is (among vs) ſo euidently and plainly performed by the Goſpell of Chriſt, that I ſhall not neede to ſtand to declare it. For our <hi>Philiſtims</hi> alſo haue their <hi>Goliath,</hi> an outgrowne monſter, of merueilous ſtature, much greater a great deale (as his Canoniſtes ſay; and vſurpation, wee knowe hath brought him vnto) then the greateſt of the great men of the earth: his furniture likewiſe, ſtrong, and fearefull: a naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to the people of God, and to God himſelfe: his mouth ſpeaking proud and cruell things agaynſt God and his people: comming into the field with a mightie armie, all enemies vnto the Trueth, and to all the profeſſors of it: ſuch as heretofore haue had the people of God in great ſubiection: of whom alſo the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> haue been ſo afrayd, that they durſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide their preſence, but haue fled from them by heapes: none of them al hauing the heart to encounter with that ſtrong &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Giant, ſo fearfully armed, and bluſtering out ſo terrible ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But now we alſo (God be prayſed) haue our <hi>David</hi> in the power of the Goſpell, that Ieſus Chriſt (the ſonne of <hi>David</hi>) hath now in theſe dayes ſent vnto vs. When our brethren diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to heare vs talke of any ſuch matter; when the wiſer ſort thought it impoſſible; without <hi>Saules</hi> armour, without any earthly helpe whatſoeuer: vpon aſſurance of ſuch like matters before atchieued, with a ſting &amp; a ſtone, is <hi>Goliath</hi> with great courage incountered, and with as good ſucceſſe, in a manner cleane ouerthrowne, euen when the attempt was either diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, or ſcorned of all. The reſidue alſo of thoſe godleſſe and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> ſeeing their champion ſo little able to ſtand before <hi>David,</hi> are likewiſe diſcomfited, and ſeeke to ſaue them ſelues by flight,<note place="margin">Such favours likewiſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foorth to the Goſpell, as were ſhewed to David be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> ſo well as they can. The fauours alſo, that by the goodneſſe of God are ſhewed, to the Goſpell, and to thoſe that profeſſe it, are not inferiour to thoſe that were (as before is declared) ſhewed to <hi>David.</hi> For (God be thanked) there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers euen of our earthly Princes (ſuch as are no better then <hi>Saul</hi>) that ſeeing the dignitie and mightie working of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13150:13"/> of Chriſt in theſe dayes of ours, are ſo taken with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of it, that themſelues loue both it, and many of thoſe that profeſſe it alſo, as much as <hi>Saul</hi> at that time loued <hi>David,</hi> and that was, as the text ſayth, very well: and, to confirme the ſame the better, both deſire to reteyne it ſtill; and beſtowe honorable roomes, and of ſpeciall credit, on thoſe that profeſſe it. Some <hi>Ionathans</hi> alſo, and godly Princes we haue beſides, that loue the Goſpell moſt entirely: and, for the Goſpels ſake, and for the loue that they beare thereunto, do gladly make a couenant with it, and with thoſe that profeſſe it; and from their owne backes moſt freely beſtow vpon it, and on thoſe that profeſſe it, both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of honor, and conuenient furniture likewiſe. Neither doth the Goſpell altogether want thoſe <hi>Michals</hi> neither, that is, ſuch godly and Chriſtian ſoules, as though they be according to the fleſh deſcended of <hi>Saul,</hi> yet beare they ſo ſpeciall a loue vnto <hi>David,</hi> that both they deſire to bee ioyned together in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with him: and are readie at al times, as need ſhall require, to ſaue the liues of thoſe that are of the Trueth (whereſoeuer they come to any ſuch daunger) how neere ſoeuer they bee vnto them, by whom ſuch perſecution is mooued. And ſo farre as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals</hi> good will may ſtand in ſtead, in time to come to helpe to the kingdome, ſo farre alſo ſhe doth not ſticke, now to beſtowe the ſame vpon him.

            <p n="4">4 To find out now in what ſort it pleaſed God to bring him to the kingdome,<note place="margin">That for a time David was exerciſed with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, before that he was brought unto the Kingdom.</note> after that once he had annointed him vnto it, and ſo effectually commended him to others, we are to knowe, that he did not bring him vnto it, till firſt he had notably exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with much affliction, ſundrie trials, and many croſſes caſt in the way. So are we firſt to conſider of thoſe his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then how it pleaſed God notwithſtanding, at length to bring him vnto the Kingdome. His afflictions were ſuch perſecutions and moleſtations, as it pleaſed <hi>Saul</hi> to ſtir vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Concerning which it is to be knowne, that they were eſpecially two: whereof the former was finiſhed with a reconciliation that was made by <hi>Jonathans</hi> meanes: the other continued ſo long as <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf did liue.<note place="margin">His former perſecution.</note> Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe two, we are firſt to ſée vpon what occaſion it was raiſed againſt him: and then what was the maner of it. The occaſion of it was firſt his owne diſtemperature:<note place="margin">The occaſion of it.</note> then the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes or likelyhood that <hi>David</hi> was in, to come to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. His owne diſtemperature (we may plainely ſée) might well be great, not only becauſe the euill ſpirit of the Lord<note n="a" place="margin">16.14.</note> was ſent vnto him, and<note n="b" place="margin">16.15.18.10.19.9.</note> oft did vexe him: but alſo for that we may ſée likewiſe, that<note n="c" place="margin">18.8.9.20.31.</note> it gréeued him much to part with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And then leſſe marueile, if he were ſo far out of temper, and conſequently ſo rageous withall, when as he did ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently take ſo great a loſſe: and ſometimes alſo was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily vexed by that euill ſpirit, that from the Lord was ſent vnto him. The towardnes or likelihood that <hi>David</hi> was in, to come to the Kingdom, was firſt in that ſentence of God, that now it ſhould be giuen to another: then for that <hi>David</hi> was likelieſt to be that other that God did ſpeake of. For the text doth not ſhew, that he knew as yet of <hi>Davids</hi> annointing: and, becauſe that he neuer ſaid any thing to <hi>Samuel</hi> about it, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe maketh any mention of it, it is the moſt likely, that he did not knowe of it. Yet thus much he knew, that<note n="d" place="margin">13.14.15.23.26.28.</note> 
               <hi>Samuel</hi> had told him twiſe alreadie, that the Lord had caſt him away, and now prouided himſelfe of another: and he might well ſee, that <hi>David</hi> was likelieſt to be that other, both for that<note n="e" place="margin">17.34.36.38.51.</note> God had wrought ſuch things by him, and for the<note n="f" place="margin">18.7.</note> fauour that now he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13150:14"/> had gotten. Concerning the maner of this his firſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, firſt he ſought by ſecret meanes,<note place="margin">The maner of it. Firſt in ſecret.</note> to haue taken away the life of <hi>David:</hi> and then he ſet in hand more openly with it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he did attempt, firſt by his owne hands to haue done it: and then by the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> By his owne hands he would firſt haue done it, at ſuch time<note n="g" place="margin">18.10.</note> as he was in one of his fits, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was playing on his inſtrument to mitigate his paſſions, euen on the morrow after that they came home from the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Goliath,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">18.11.</note> twiſe together he had in his mind, for to haue executed this miſcheuous purpoſe. A wonderfull thing that he ſhould be ſo minded, though he had bin ſo minded but once: not only in reſpect of the fact it ſelfe, but alſo in reſpect of diuers circumſtances thereunto apperteining. The fact it ſelfe muſt néedes haue bin wilfull murther: then the which there néeded no greater, both to haue conuinced him of great iniquitie before men, and vtterly to haue caſt himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before God. The circumſtances that are, do chiefly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto their perſons, but partly alſo vnto the time. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are two: <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David. Saul</hi> being the King, and ſo conſequently being ordeined to be the mainteiner of equitie, and a buckler and ſhield vnto the oppreſſed, ought not to haue made ſuch a fault himſelfe: beſides that at that time, being in one of his fits, and ſenſibly féeling the hand of God vpon him for his former ſinnes, he ſhould rather haue vſed it to his further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, then ſo to take the aduantage of it, to a further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. <hi>David</hi> was not only innocent, but alſo had (in that verie matter for the which he ſhould haue bin deſtroied) deſerued marueilous well, both of all generally, for that he had giuen ſo great an ouerthrowe vnto the common enimie of all, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe they were, by reaſon of the perſon that he ſuſteined, enemies to none ſo much as to him. The time when he would haue done this miſchiefe, was the verie next day after that they were welcomed home from the victorie, the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing and ſinging vnto them, that <hi>Saul</hi> had ſlaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſand: as vnſeaſonable a time for ſuch a purpoſe, as could be deuiſed, becauſe that as yet the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that he had receiued was ſo freſh, that it ought ſo to haue fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13150:15"/> all the powers of his mind with all thankefull remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as that there might haue bin no corner at all in his heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo much as a little ſpark of ſo great vnthankfulnes might find any place. In that he had this purpoſe twiſe, it doth both argue his vnthankfulnes and ill dealing to be ſo much the greater: and might be withall a warning to <hi>David</hi> not to thinke, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Saul</hi> had once failed, when firſt he attempted to do him that miſchiefe, he would neuer for ſhame attempt it againe. When this way failed, he then thought good, that it ſhould be done by the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> his hand now ſhould not be vpon him. And that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Philiſtims</hi> it might better be done, he<note n="i" place="margin">18.13.</note> both gaue him the charge of a thouſand men, and would needes<note n="k" place="margin">18.17.21.</note> ſet him foorth one of his daughters in mariage alſo. In giuing him charge ouer ſuch a band of ſouldiers, he would ſeeme, not only to put him in truſt, but alſo to ſeeke his preferment and honour: and yet (in truth) he ſought nothing elſe but his ouerthrow, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that by that occaſion, more boldly encountering with the enemie, one time or other he ſhould be ouerthrowne. In ſetting him forth one of his daughters in mariage, and in ſuch ſort as he did, (both<note n="l" place="margin">18.22.25.</note> earneſtly labouring it by ſuch meanes as he vſed, and<note n="m" place="margin">18.25.</note> requiring of him no other dowry, but an hundreth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkins of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi>) although (in truth) he ſought<note n="n" place="margin">18.17.21.25.</note> nothing elſe in this alſo, but only his ouerthrow: yet herein did he ſéeke it more cunningly (and therefore to <hi>David</hi> ſo much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly) for that hereby he would ſeeme, both to beare a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour to <hi>David,</hi> and, in the ouerthrow of the enemy, chiefly to reſpect the cauſe of religion. The former of them is plaine inough in it ſelfe. The latter alſo doth plainly appeare, for that he doth not require their heads, or other parts, but only their foreſkins: which (in thoſe dayes) was a ſpeciall difference betwixt the people of God, and the heathen. When he had made ſome triall of thoſe ſecret practiſes,<note place="margin">Then openly.</note> and found that they neuer came to any ſuch proofe, as he deſired (but on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide<note n="o" place="margin">18.27.28.</note> that they were meanes to make <hi>David</hi> both much ſtronger, and more renouned then he was before) being able now to ſtay no longer, he<note n="p" place="margin">18.29.19.1.</note> brake forth into open perſecution, and gaue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall charge both vnto <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and to all his ſeruants, one
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13150:15"/> way or other to make him away: wherein it ſeemeth, that he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Ionathan,</hi> as one of whome he might be aſſured: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the ſpedier diſpatch of the matter. It might ſéeme that he might make ſure of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> both becauſe he was his ſonne, and eſpecially becauſe that the cauſe was his, ſo néere as it was. For being the Kings ſonne, and next to the Crowne by lineall deſcent, it was likely in reaſon, that he would haue bin as readie as <hi>Saul,</hi> to haue taken <hi>David</hi> out of the way. And his other ſeruants being many, it was likely alſo, that ſéeing he gaue the charge to them all, it muſt needs be quickly diſpatcht: either for emulation among themſelues; who ſhould firſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the King therein, or for that ſome one or other among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was like to be found, that would attempt any miſchiefe whatſoeuer, hauing once the Kings commandement for it. Howbeit, <hi>Ionathan</hi> héereupon ſo<note n="q" place="margin">19.4.5.</note> laboured the King (after that<note n="r" place="margin">19.2.3.</note> firſt he had warned <hi>David</hi> to keepe himſelfe cloſe) that he wrought a reconciliation betwixt them: and ſo this firſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ceaſſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In which poynt if we come to our ſelues,<note place="margin">That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in theſe dayes is vnder the like perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution alſo.</note> and to the eſtate of theſe our dayes wherein we liue, it is euident enough, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the courſe of the Goſpell be in ſuch ſort bleſſed alreadie, as that we may ſee that it is like to preuayle in the end: yet is it ſo croſſed alſo by many, that it is not to be looked for of vs, but that it is to paſſe through great tribulation, before that it ſhall atteyne to the victorie that after enſueth. And as it was <hi>Saul</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſo perſecuted <hi>David,</hi> and held him back (ſo much as he could) from the eſtate that God had prouided for him: euen ſo we may ſee (at this day alſo) many Princes &amp; great ſtates of Chriſtendome, much to hinder the courſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; and, as they finde opportunitie to ſerue their turne, ſtill to ſtirre vp perſecution agaynſt it. But to the end that all things may ſo much the better appeare in euery poynt, if wee conſider the matter well, we may plainly ſee,<note place="margin">The occaſion of this perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be al one with the other.</note> that ſuch as was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſuch as was the manner of that perſecution of his; ſuch alſo is the occaſion, and ſuch is the manner of this perſecution of theirs alſo. For firſt as touching the occaſion of it, not only <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo much mooued vnto it by that euil ſpirit to perſecute
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13150:16"/> 
               <hi>David:</hi> but theſe alſo, out of the ſelfſame ſolicitation, come forth with many of their perſecutions agaynſt the Goſpell. For though by the common corruption of nature themſelues alſo are bent agaynſt it, euen of themſelues, without the ſolicitation or helpe of an other: yet after that themſelues are diſpoſed ſtill to abide in that corruption of theirs (refuſing the Goſpell, by which they ſhould be begotten agayne the children of God) it is moſt certeyne, that they cannot bee alone in any ſuch action of theirs as this. For he that goeth about like a roring Lion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom he may deuoure, finding them ſo fit inſtruments for his purpoſe, to trouble the courſe of the Goſpell, and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the profeſſors thereof, will ſoone bee with them, and hurrie them headlong to and fro to his moſt aduantage. So that it neede not to be doubted, but is in it ſelf ſo cleare as may be, that moſt of our perſecutions alſo, that are by worldly and godleſſe Princes rayſed agaynſt vs, may well bee referred to that euill ſpirit that reigneth in the world, and hath alreadie ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed theſe <hi>Saules</hi> of ours. Neither is it only by this euill ſpirit of the Lord, that theſe <hi>Saules</hi> of ours are ſo farre out of temper: but for that it gréeueth them alſo to part with their kingdome. Not that the Goſpell doth any way meddle in the diſpoſing of earthly kingdomes, or to encomber the title of any (whether it be by deſcent, or election; of one, or mo; or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other forme their ſtate may haue:) but for that it calleth to account their maner of gouernment, and ſometime vrgeth them to make a plaine alteration of it. For commonly it findeth the Princes of the world ſo farre out of order in their maner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment (in matters of religion very often: and ſometimes in ſuch things alſo as do concerne their ciuill eſtate) that it cannot but ſtrongly vrge them to make alteration therein. So farre therefore as they are wedded vnto their corrupt manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and ſo farre as they account their kingdomes and ſtates to ſtand therby: ſo farre alſo may they ſtand in ſome doubt of their kingdomes by reaſon of the Goſpell, and feare that it will moleſt them therein. And then is it (in this reſpect alſo) no great merueile, if many of them be ſo ill minded towards the Goſpell, as ſuch diſcourteſies of theirs do import. On the other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13150:16"/> ſide, as the towardlineſſe of <hi>David</hi> was one of the matters that ſo much did whet <hi>Saul</hi> agaynſt him: ſo at this day alſo it is not the leaſt, that mooueth Princes to bee ſo greeuous agaynſt the Goſpell, becauſe they ſee that it is ſo likely to preuayle as it is. For they ſee well enough that the Goſpell hath the ſelfe ſame likelihoods to preuayle that <hi>David</hi> had. For as touching that manner of gouernment which worldly Princes haue ſet vp of themſelues, but not agreeable to the word of God, the text it ſelf<note n="a." place="margin">Ier. 23.1.8. Eze. 34.1.24. Nah. 3.17.19. Zec 11.8.15.17. Math. 15.13. 2. Cor. 10.5. &amp;c.</note> doth plainly witneſſe (more often then twiſe) that it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, and a better brought in, in the place thereof. And that it is the kingdome of Chriſt, whereunto thoſe others are to giue place, and which is to ſucceede in their roumes, is in like ſort playnlie ſet downe<note n="b." place="margin">Iſay. 9.5.6. Dan. 2.44.45.</note> in many places, or rather throughout the whole courſe of the Scripture, from the beginning vnto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: beſides that in theſe dayes of ours, not only ſuch great things are done thereby; but it hath gotten great fauour alſo. That ſuch great things are done thereby, as before were done by <hi>David,</hi> may ſufficiently appeare in that which is before ſet downe: and that it hath gotten ſuch fauour with many, is playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeene in theſe dayes of ours, when as many Princes and States haue wholly yeelded to the obedience of it, and not a fewe among thoſe alſo that are moſt agaynſt it. Neither is it materiall in this caſe of ours, that the annoynting of this our <hi>David</hi> hath not been in ſo publike manner, as fleſh and bloud would conceiue had been moſt conuenient. Men may not looke to beare ſuch a ſway in the matters of God. The Goſpell is not therefore to be refuſed by any, becauſe they were not made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vnto the inauguration of it, nor called vnto it. God that is free, and in nothing to hang vpon any, is in ſuch caſe eſpecially to ſhewe it, and euer to vſe his freedome therein.<note place="margin">It proceedeth in the ſelf ſame manner that was vſed in the other before.</note> As touching the manner of their perſecution, that vpon this occaſion they haue rayſed, therein alſo they do fitly anſwer the patterne that we find in the other. For firſt they labour themſelues to do it in ſecret: then do they openly fall vnto it. In ſecret alſo ſometimes they labour themſelues to do it:<note place="margin">Firſt in ſecret.</note> ſometimes agayne they will haue it done by the hand of others. And euen as <hi>Saul</hi> being the King, would neuertheleſſe by his owne hands haue taken him away
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13150:17"/> in very ill manner: ſo are there diuers of our Princes alſo that haue not thought it vnſeemly for them, to lend foorth their owne hands to the perſecution of the Goſpell, altogether in as ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Saul</hi> in that other. If that which <hi>Saul</hi> meant agaynſt <hi>David</hi> were no leſſe then murther: neither can theſe <hi>Saules</hi> of ours hold themſelues contented with leſſe. Inſomuch that they which by vertue of their office ought to bee a ſhield and defence to all thoſe that are oppreſſed, themſelues are readie, euen with their owne hands to do that violence, that in no wiſe they ſhould ſuffer to be offered by any. And, as they are as forward as <hi>Saul</hi> in this: ſo are they not behind in the other neither, for diuers of them. For on them alſo is layd the hand of God in ſenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in ſuch ſort (either on their owne perſon, or on their States) as doth plainly vrge them vnto repentance, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtriue no longer agaynſt the Goſpell offered vnto them: and yet being vnder ſome ſuch ſpeciall hand of God, they neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe haue a ſecret intent, one way, or other to make away the Goſpell of Chriſt, and vtterly to chace it away from the face of the earth. And as <hi>David</hi> had deſerued merueilous well, in that very matter for the which he ſhould haue been deſtroyed, both of all generally, and more ſpecially of <hi>Saul:</hi> ſo the Goſpel likewiſe of thoſe that croſſe it ſo much as they do, both generally of them altogether, and more ſpecially of thoſe that are the leaders of them. For the Goſpell alſo in theſe our dayes, and before our eyes (wee ſtanding by and looking thereon) hath ouerthrowne thoſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> of ours: which were both common enemies vnto all; and ſpecially to Princes themſelues. Common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they were vnto all, whether wee reſpect the ſlauerie that they held vs in; or whether wee reſpect the corruption of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and life, that they brought with them. Vnto Princes more ſpecially they were ſo daungerous enemies, both becauſe that they tooke them downe, and got aboue them: and for that the corruption that they bring with them is ſo contrary as it is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right and orderly gouernment of any ſtate. The time likewiſe is the ſame with theſe, that it was with <hi>Saul:</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after that they haue receiued, by the benefite of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, ſo many good bleſſings, as ought to haue filled all the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13150:17"/> powers of them with moſt thankfull eſtimation thereof. And whereas <hi>Saul</hi> (as yet) had this purpoſe with him but twiſe, theſe of ours haue had it more often: and therewithall doe both ſhewe themſelues more playnlie, and leaue a ſufficient warning to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how little in ſuch caſe they are to be truſted. But when themſelues are not able ſo to performe their ſecret intents, then will they ſeeme buſily to ſeeke the preferment of thoſe, whom they would haue ſo fayne diſpatched: then muſt they bee put in ſome ſpeciall truſt; then muſt there bee treatie of ſome ſpeciall mariage. Which things are ſo cleare in themſelues, that wee neede not take any paynes to ſhewe them: this only ſhalbe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for vs, to knowe what they meane, when any of that ſort, do offer ſuch fauours to any of vs. Our ſelues may yet very well remember (and cannot forget it, would we neuer ſo fayne) what hurt the cauſe of religion ſuſteyneth by accepting ſuch courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies from them. And yet notwithſtanding, as in ſome particular caſes the cauſe of religion hath been for a time hindred thereby; ſo hath it been at other times (and that very often) by ſuch kinde of dealing notably holpen, though full ſore agaynſt their wils: God, of his goodneſſe, ſo diſpoſing, that the ſame that they had layd as a baite or ſnare vnto vs, ſhould turne to ſome great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the cauſe of the Goſpell, &amp; withall be a ſnare to thoſe that layd it. And as <hi>Saul</hi> would ſeeme in that his preferment of <hi>David,</hi> not to ſeeke the ouerthrowe of any, but only of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie of both: ſo hath it been the manner of diuers among vs, with ſuch colour to caſt thoſe into daunger, by whom they haue ſeene the cauſe of the Goſpell to be mainteyned. To warre on the Turke for the holy land, was wont to bee an old tale to ſuch a purpoſe: but that being knowne vnto all, and their deuiſe being growne much finer now, they handle their matters ſo much more cunningly, and ſo much the hardlier can bee eſpied. Whereby notwithſtanding themſelues do finde that they haue preuayled ſo little,<note place="margin">Then openly.</note> that as with <hi>Saul</hi> they haue walked in the darke for a time: ſo do they as readily with him alſo breake forth into open tyrannie. For howſoeuer it be the manner of ſuch, to diſpatch their purpoſes in ſecret, if they may: yet when in ſuch ſort they cannot come to the end of their wicked endeuours, then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13150:18"/> doe they fall openly in hande therewith, howſoeuer they can thinke, that any way is open vnto them. And as <hi>Saul</hi> gaue a more ſpeciall charge vnto <hi>Ionathan</hi> for the execution of that matter, and then generally to all his ſeruaunts beſides: ſo theſe likewiſe take the ſame courſe, that ſo they may the ſooner attain vnto their deſire. They ſpecially ſtirre vp all ſuch <hi>Ionathans</hi> as they haue among them, that is, all ſuch, as may ſeeme to bee touched any thing nere, with the quarrell that they haue taken vpon them: hoping that the neerer that they are touched with it, the more willing and ready they will be, to ioyne with them in this kind of quarrel the beſt that they can. And to the end that it faile not to be done, they in like ſort giue the ſame charge to all their ſeruaunts generally: that howſoeuer it may fall out, that ſome of them cannot be induced vnto it, and others may want ſuch opportunities, or ſuch other meanes as were needefull to ſuch a purpoſe; yet among ſo many there might euer bee ſome, by whome it might bee as fully effected as themſelues coulde deſire. In which point, the likelihood in this caſe is ſo much the greater, as we may ſee, that the commaundement of a King to doe ſuch a matter, is in it ſelfe neuer ſo ſtrong, as when there is a perſwaſion conceiued, that the ſame hath a further warrant from the head of the church that cannot erre: and beeing done, as they thinke, on the behalfe of the catholicke Church, is not onely allowable, but commendable alſo, and meritorious. Princes we may thinke, may haue their infirmities, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſomtimes, without any cauſe to take away ſuch, as they are offended withall. But when it is further, not onely warranted, but ſtrongly alſo vrged by him, that is thought to do all things by the onely direction of Gods holy ſpirite, that carieth ſuch a colour with many, as that they thinke, they neede no more to excuſe them for any thing, whatſoeuer it bee, euen before the iudgement ſeat of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 As touching the latter of thoſe perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> were raiſed by <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His latter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cecution.</note> as it was by <hi>Saul</hi> more egerly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the former: ſo God on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide afforded <hi>David</hi> a litle more help in this, then he did in the other.

The occaſion of it.</note> that herein it pleaſed God to giue him. In the perſecution it ſelfe we are again to conſider the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, and then the maner of it likewiſe. The occaſion of it was in a maner the ſame that was before: <hi>Davids</hi> good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe againſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and for that the euill ſpirite of the Lorde, was nowe againe come vpon <hi>Saul.</hi> That <hi>Davids</hi> good ſucceſſe againſt the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> ſhould be ſome part of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that now again he raiſed this perſecution againſt him, may well appeare, for that it goeth immediatly before in the text, that<note n="a" place="margin">19.8.</note> the warre began again with the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> going foorth againſt them, put them to flight, and ſlewe them with a great ſlaughter. For <hi>Saul</hi> muſt needes perceiue thereby, that as that victory was honourable vnto him: ſo muſt it make him the ſtronger alſo. That the returne of the euill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Lord vnto him againe, was an other part of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo, may likewiſe appeare, for that it followeth immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, (and before that any thing is noted of the maner of this perſecution)<note n="b" place="margin">19.9.</note> that the euil ſpirit of the Lord was vpon him, at ſuch time, as when he firſt began this perſecution.<note place="margin">The maner of it.</note> As touching the maner of it, it is to be knowne, that euen as firſt he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do it in ſecret, &amp; afterward openly: euen ſo now alſo hee ſtill obſerueth the ſame courſe. In his ſecret practiſing of it,<note place="margin">Secretly firſt.</note> we are to note, that firſt himſelfe purſueth <hi>David:</hi> and then ceaſing for a time from that purſuit, awaiteth when <hi>David,</hi> by the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of a ſpecial time, ſhould vnwittingly come into his hands of his own accord. Himſelfe purſueth him, firſt at hand: and then ſomewhat further of a ſunder. At hand he did it, as before; when<note n="c" place="margin">19.9.10.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> was playing on his inſtrument, ſomething to eaſe him of thoſe his paſſions: at which time <hi>Saul</hi> was ſecretly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with himſelfe, with his Iaueling that he had in his hande, ſuddenly to haue ſtroken him vnto the wall; and came ſo neere to the effecting of his purpoſe, that he ſtroke at him, &amp; ſmote his ſpeare into the wall where <hi>David</hi> ſate. Somewhat further of he did it, immediatly after, when as <hi>David</hi> hereupon did flee, to ſaue himſelf: and that he did firſt by certaine meſſengers, and then by himſelf. By meſſengers he purſued him twiſe:<note n="d" place="margin">19.11.17.</note> firſt to his own houſe, whether he had eſcaped at that preſent; and then ſoone after<note n="e" place="margin">19.18.21.</note> to <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi> whither he fledde, after that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13150:19"/> he was fayne to leaue his own houſe to ſaue his life. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe his purſuites of <hi>David,</hi> by his meſſengers, he doth plainly ſhew himſelfe to be egerly bent to haue his life, both by his dealing with thoſe his meſſengers, ſo long as he ſtoode in hope to obtayne the pray hee deſired: and by his dealing with <hi>Michal</hi> his daughter, <hi>Davids</hi> wife, after that he ſaw he was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. That dealing of his with thoſe his meſſengers, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth him to bee greedily bent to haue his life, reſteth in two principall points: firſt that<note n="f" place="margin">19.11.</note> he gaue them charge to kill him, when as he knew not how he himſelfe might be able to reache him; then, when they brought him word that hee was in his bed ſicke, that<note n="g" place="margin">19.15.</note> he ſent them againe to ſee him, and to bring him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way bed and all, that he might ſlay him. His dealing with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> reſteth likewiſe in theſe two pointes: that<note n="h" place="margin">19.17.</note> hee rebuketh her for ſending him away, and counteth himſelfe mocked ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And yet, both ſhe was his owne daughter: and now alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by himſelfe in mariage to <hi>David.</hi> Of which two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as the former of them might well haue pacified him (in ſuch a caſe as this) euen onely for that ſhe was his daughter: ſo the other ought to haue made him aſhamed alſo, that he ſhould ſo much as looke for, that ſhe, being his wife now, ſhoulde haue bene ſo trecherous vnto her huſband. In the latter of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of <hi>David</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard that he was at <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi> in one point he doth better cloake that greedineſſe of his to haue his blood; but in another he bewrayeth himſelfe playnly again. He cloaketh his greedineſſe ſomewhat better, in that nowe<note n="i" place="margin">19.20.</note> hee giueth no further charge (that we read off) but only to take him, and to bring him vnto him: which, it may be, was for the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he bare vnto <hi>Samuel</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">19.18.</note> with whom <hi>David</hi> ſoiourned now. That other point, wherein notwithſtanding hee plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how greedily he was bent to haue him, is, for that hee ſent<note n="l" place="margin">19.20.22.</note> ſo often for him, (by three ſeuerall companies): &amp; that,<note n="m" place="margin">19.20.</note> when as he vnderſtood in how wonderful maner the firſt ſort of them were defeated, and ſtrongly eluded (and yet in very gracious manner) by the mightie power of God. By himſelf hee manned foorth this his purſuit, when as he ſaw that his meſſengers had not done, as he would haue them: For then<note n="n" place="margin">19 22.</note> he went himſelfe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13150:19"/> alſo: loath to leeſe ſo goodly a pray, when now hee did ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know where to haue him. A ſtraunge, and yet a pitifull ſight, to ſee the King himſelfe, that ſhould be a defence vnto the oppreſſed, ſo greedily to followe vpon innocent bloode: and of ſuch a one too, as both had deſerued well before, and whome he might ſo playnly ſee, to be by the mighty hand of God defended now. When ſo<note n="o" place="margin">19.23.24</note> he was, in his owne perſon, in like ſort defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as all his three companies of catchpoles were before) then he ceaſed for a time from that purſuit, and awaited when <hi>David,</hi> by the oportunitie of a ſpeciall time, ſhould vnwittingly come into his handes of his owne accord. Which ſpeciall time was the<note n="p" place="margin">20.5.18.</note> new moone, or the beginning of the moneth next appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: and the opportunity which that time brought with it, was, for that at ſuch times<note n="q" place="margin">20.6.</note> they held of cuſtom ſolemne feaſts vnto the Lorde, and <hi>David</hi> at ſuch times<note n="r" place="margin">20.5.18.</note> was to ſit at meate with the king. That <hi>Saul</hi> did ſecretely awayte this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the text it ſelfe doth not directly ſay: but yet may it bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that ſo hee did, both becauſe that<note n="ſ" place="margin">20.5.7.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> conceiued that doubt of him, and<note n="t" place="margin">20.5.</note> thereupon abſented himſelfe to preuent the perill, and for that <hi>Saul</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">20.30.31.33.</note> was ſo very angry that hee was not there, and<note n="x" place="margin">20.31.</note> therewithall commaunded <hi>Ionathan</hi> forthwith to ſend for him thither, that he might ſlay him. That all this while hitherto <hi>Saul</hi> in this ſort purſued <hi>David</hi> but in ſecrete maner, ſauing onely that he did impart his meaning to thoſe whom he vſed to that purpoſe (ſo needes he muſt, or at leaſt a good part of it) may hereby appeare, both for that<note n="y" place="margin">20.2.9.</note> 
               <hi>Ionathan</hi> was ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of it, and thereupon would needes aſſure <hi>David</hi> that his father had no ſuch purpoſe: and for that <hi>David</hi> himſelfe<note n="z" place="margin">20.5.6.</note> did not as yet openly ſhunne him, but abſented himſelfe vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of other buſineſſe.<note place="margin">Openly after.</note> But being now againe in this ſort defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all his ſecret practiſes, he thereupon ſetteth in hand again to lay all coulours aſide now, and openly to ruſh vpon it, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he may. Wherein we haue ſet downe vnto vs, firſt how he rageth againſt others for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake: then how hee perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelf likewiſe. His rage againſt others for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake,<note place="margin">Firſt raging againſt others for Davids ſake.</note> did partly appear, euen at that inſtant, when <hi>Ionathan</hi> excuſed that abſence of <hi>David:</hi> but much more a litle after. It did then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13150:20"/> partly appeare,<note place="margin">Againſt Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> becauſe at that time both<note n="a" place="margin">20.30.</note> he fowly reuiled <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> his ſonne: and beſides that<note n="b" place="margin">20.33.</note> caſt his ſpeare at him to haue ſlayne him. A little after it did more fully appeare, both in a certain ſpeeche of his to his ſeruants: &amp; in his cruelty againſt certain others. In that ſpeech of his to his ſeruants, hee layeth greeuous things to the charge, partly of them al that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: but eſpecially of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> alſo, who then was abſent. Vnto the charge of his ſeruaunts hee layeth, that<note n="c" place="margin">20.8.</note> they alſo, and they all had conſpired againſt him (becauſe they tolde him not,<note place="margin">Againſt his ſeruaunts.</note> that his ſonne had made a couenaunt with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and had ſtirred vp <hi>David</hi> againſt him,) and that none of them were ſory for him; and<note n="d" place="margin">20.7.</note> that by all likelihoode they were wonne thereunto by ſome great promiſes of <hi>David,</hi> both of commodities, and of preferments. Vnto the charge of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> he layeth<note n="e" place="margin">20.8.</note> that the one had conſpired againſt him,<note place="margin">Againſt the Prieſts of the Lord.</note> and to lye in wayte for him: and that the other had made a couenant with him, and ſet him on. Theſe others againſt whom he ſhewed ſuch cruelty, were certaine Prieſts of the Lorde, and many others together with them. Concerning which we are to note, both how great cruelty he ſhewed: and vpon howe ſmall occaſion. His cruelty appeared for that he<note n="f" place="margin">22.18.</note> ſlew ſo many prieſts of the Lorde, euen foureſcore and fiue: (which his<note n="*" place="margin">22.17.</note> owne men abhorred ſo much, that he could not get them to be executioners of his bloody commaundement) and<note n="g" place="margin">22.19.</note> deſtroyed beſides both men, women, and children, Oxen, Aſſes, and Sheepe, and the whole city of <hi>Nob</hi> where thoſe Prieſtes had their aboade. The occaſion was ſmall, becauſe the fault (if any there were) was but in<note n="h" place="margin">22.9.10.</note> one man, <hi>Ahimelech</hi> only, and that none other, but that (<note n="i" place="margin">22 14.15.</note> not knowing then, but that <hi>David</hi> was in high fauour with <hi>Saul</hi>)<note n="k" place="margin">22.10.</note> he both aſked counſell for him of the Lord, and did a little relieue him with ſome victuals, and with a ſworde, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> had good right vnto, hauing wonne it of <hi>Goliath</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the field: and all this,<note n="l" place="margin">22.9.22.</note> but vpon the accuſation onely of one euill perſon,<note place="margin">Then againſt David himſelf.</note> 
               <hi>Doeg</hi> an <hi>Edomite.</hi> After that ſo he had raged againſt others, then doth he follow on <hi>David</hi> himſelfe: and that in ſuch ſort, that it may appeare hee was egerly ſet, not onely by the nature of thoſe his purſuits in themſelues, but alſo by one ſpeciall circumſtance theron depending. As touching the nature
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13150:20"/> of thoſe his purſuits in themſelues, it is ſet downe how he did follow vpon him, firſt when <hi>David</hi> vpon certaine occaſion, was now gotten into a citie: and then failing of his purpoſe there, afterwards in the fields at large. The citie was<note n="m" place="margin">23.1.</note> 
               <hi>Keilah,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ioſ. 15.22.</note> in the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> whether<note n="o" place="margin">23.5.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> went to fight againſt the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> that came againſt it, &amp; ſpoyled theraboutes: whom when <hi>David</hi> had ouerthrowne, he remained with the citizens of <hi>Keilah</hi> for a certaine ſeaſon. But when<note n="p" place="margin">23.7.8.</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> came againſt him, hoping now that he had him ſure,<note n="q" place="margin">23.12.13.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> vnderſtanding that the lords of <hi>Keilah</hi> would not ſtand faſt vnto him, got him thence, and ſo defeated <hi>Saul</hi> in that his enterpriſe. How hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on him in the fields, we haue the ſame firſt ſet downe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally: then certaine of thoſe his purſuits more ſpecially. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former, there is no more ſet downe but this,<note n="r" place="margin">23.14</note> that he ſought him euery day. Concerning the other, there are ſet downe three ſpeciall purſuites: one of them broken of, by the comming in of the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> the other two by the kindnes &amp; faithfull caling of <hi>David</hi> himſelfe. That which was broken of by the comming of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> did haſſard <hi>David</hi> very ſore: partly for that the <hi>Ziphims</hi> (who,<note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Par. 2.42.</note> as it ſeemeth, were of that <hi>Ziph</hi> that was ſonne to <hi>Caleb,</hi> and then were they of one tribe with <hi>David</hi>)<note n="t" place="margin">23.19.20.</note> vndertooke to betray him: and for that<note n="u" place="margin">23.26.</note> 
               <hi>Saul,</hi> hauing got that aduantage, did ſo hotly purſue him, that being for a time but on the one ſide of the hill, while they were on the other, at the length hee had compaſſed them in (but, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnwitting to him) on euery ſide. But then on the ſudden<note n="x" place="margin">23.27.</note> he was fayne to breake off, becauſe he had word, that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> had entred already. Of thoſe others that were broken of by the kindneſſe and faythfull dealing of <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, the former of them was in <hi>Engedi:</hi> the other in <hi>Ziph.</hi> In the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of <hi>Engedi</hi> it was that he purſued <hi>David</hi> ſo hotly (euen<note n="y" place="margin">24.2.</note> among the tops of the rocks, where no body els but only wild goats were wont to bee) that in the ende<note n="z" place="margin">24.45 12.</note> he fell into <hi>Davids</hi> hands, entering into a caue where <hi>David</hi> was: and there fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>David</hi> had ſpared him when hee was in his handes, thereupon<note n="a" place="margin">24.22.</note> he left of purſuing him for that preſent. But hauing as yet his wonted blood-thirſtineſſe remaining in him (though<note n="b" place="margin">24.16.22.</note> it were for a time ſomewhat flaked, by that great and ſingular
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13150:21"/> fauour that he found at the hands of <hi>David</hi> on his part altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much vnlooked for, as vndeſerued) hee doth no ſooner get opportunitie, but foorthwith he returneth vnto his olde bias againe. Heere therefore it is good to conſider, not onely how he came in with this his other purſuite: but alſo howe fayre likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods he had giuen, that hee would neuer haue done it againe. He came foorth with his other purſuit, by occaſion of the <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">26.1.</note> who nowe againe came and tolde him where <hi>David</hi> was: whereupon<note n="d" place="margin">26.2.</note> he came foorth again with 3000 choſen men to ſet vpon him. But <hi>David</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">26.7.</note> priuily comming into his campe, when he, and his company were faſt a ſleep,<note n="f" place="margin">26.12.</note> tooke thence ſuch tokens with him, as whereby he was able to ſhew, that hee had the king in his handes, to haue done with him whatſoeuer hee woulde. Which when the king perceiued<note n="g" place="margin">26.21.25</note> he was now againe for the time ſo mooued with it, that preſently hee brake of this his purſuit, and ſo returned home againe. The likelihoodes that <hi>Saul</hi> had giuen, that he would neuer haue offered to <hi>David</hi> ſo hard meaſure againe, were,<note n="h" place="margin">24.22.</note> that he did acknowledge his fault in purſuing of him, and beſought his fauour vnto his ſeede: and theſe with teares. That ſpeciall circumſtaunce that dependeth heereon, and ſomewhat better helpeth forward to ſhewe howe egerly he was ſet vpon <hi>David,</hi> was, that ſo much hee followed on him, when as it had bene a great deale meeter to haue deale with the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> the common enimie, becauſe that they,<note n="i" place="margin">23.1.</note> both came vnto <hi>Keilah,</hi> and fought againſt it, and<note n="k" place="margin">23.27.28</note> afterward againe came into the land, during the time of this his purſuing of innocent <hi>David.</hi> The litle helpe that in this perſecution God did giue him,<note place="margin">What helpe it pleaſed God to afford him in this perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was in the company that came vnto him for his defence, when hee was in diſtreſſe by that perſecution, to the number of ſixe hundred men in all. Whereof<note n="l" place="margin">22.1.2.</note> fower hundred came vnto him while he was at <hi>Adullam,</hi> and other two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mo a while after. For we haue mention of ſixe hundred in all,<note n="m" place="margin">23.13.</note> both when he departed from <hi>Keilah:</hi> and<note n="n" place="margin">30.10.</note> when he went againſt the <hi>Amalekites</hi> that had ſpoyled <hi>Ziklag.</hi> The firſt fower hundred<note n="o" place="margin">22.1.2.</note> were, ſome of his kindred: the reſidue ſuch as were in debt or timber. Of the other, there is no ſpeciall thing reported: not ſo much as the time when they came vnto him.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13150:21"/> Sauing that, ſéeing they are found with <hi>David</hi> when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Keilah,</hi> and we haue no mention of them before, it may ſeeme that they came vnto him while he was there. And likely inough, that ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> was knowne to be of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that ſuch as were diſpoſed to giue themſelues to ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, would eaſily vpon ſuch occaſion reſort vnto him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 All which things if in theſe dayes we ſhall apply to our ſelues, and lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch doings, as our eies haue often ſeene,<note place="margin">That this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſecution of Davids, is rightly exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in theſe dayes alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpell.</note> and dayly yet ſée: we ſhall find them to agrée ſo fitly together, as could be deuiſed, and ſufficiently to teach vs, both what to looke for at the hands of many, and how warily to behaue our ſelues in the meane ſeaſon: whether we reſpect the occaſion of this his perſecution, or elſe but the maner whereby it procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.

And yet notwithſtanding if we come to the maner of ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theirs,<note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> we ſhall commonly find, that for the moſt part they euer proceede, in ſuch ſort, as the patterne before preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth vnto vs, and almoſt euen after the ſelfeſame manner that before they find in the other.<note place="margin">Firſt in ſecret.</note> For firſt they do euer deſire to do it in ſecret maner, ſo neere as they can: and then if they find that ſo they cannot, they ſtick not likewiſe to ruſh vpon it, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they thinke occaſion offered. And as <hi>Saul</hi> would now again firſt haue done it by his owne hands, in another mad fit of his, ſo to haue coloured the matter the better, and now came verie néere vnto it, belike becauſe that <hi>David</hi> did ouermuch truſt the oath that he did take to the contrarie a little before: euen ſo we may ſee that our <hi>Sauls</hi> alſo would not ſtick with their owne hands to put ſuch things in execution, eſpecially, the caſe being ſuch, as would affoord them any reaſonable coulour vnto it: whereunto they alſo come oftimes ouer néere, for that vpon their promiſes and oathes they are ouermuch truſted. When themſelues are not able to do it, then do they imploy others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and that howſoeuer oportunitie is offered: neither ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch as be ſick, but ſéeking to haue them bed and all, nor ſo much as able either to hold pacience with any (though neuer ſo néere) that any way fruſtrate their wicked attempts, or to find any other meaning if ſo they ſhould, but that they are mocked therein. And that which is more, when they find themſelues in ſuch ſort defeated, as that they may plainly perceiue, that it is no meaner then God himſelfe that doth reſiſt them: and though he do the ſame alſo in neuer ſo good and gracious maner, yet will they neuer be warned thereby, nor any thing ſtaied in their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13150:22"/> wicked attempts, but euer run on to the vttermoſt point that they are able to reach. Neither are they able to denie, but that by the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, which in others they perſecute with all extremities, many of themſelues are ſo taken, that they alſo prophecie in manie things, in reſpect of that palpable error that both we and they were in before, and of that knowledge that now we haue common vnto vs both. In which caſe alſo if any man thinke, that they ſhould ſo reuerence, either that ſpeciall gift of Prophecie (an euident worke of the ſpirit of God) or his great goodnes to them,<note place="margin">2.

If that will not, the daily experience of theſe daies of ours, is ſo paſſing fruitfull in ſuch examples, that it only may put it cleane out of queſtion. And as <hi>Saul,</hi> when he ſaw that he did no good in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of him, withdrew himſelfe for a time, to await ſome ſuch opportunitie, as that <hi>David</hi> might of himſelfe haue falne into his hands, and for that purpoſe ſtooke not to take a time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſpeciall deuotion, for to accompliſh his bloudie enterpriſe: ſo theſe likewiſe both await ſuch opportunities, and ſtick not for any ſolemnitie of the time whatſoeuer, but can redily find in their hearts, then to commit any iniquitie whatſoeuer, when as the time doth ſpecially call them, vtterly to abandon all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and with all ſinceritie and holines of mind to ſanctifie themſelues vnto the Lord.<note place="margin">Then openly.</note> Comming vnto their open practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there alſo we find that their rage is ſo great, that firſt others féele it for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake: and then,<note place="margin">Againſt others for the Goſpels ſake.</note> that they purſue <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe likewiſe all that they can. And among others that find of their outrageous crueltie for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, ſometime <hi>Jonathan</hi> himſelfe is not frée. For néerenes of bloud in this caſe helpeth but little oftentimes: and it were no hard matter to find a great Prince among vs, that not only attempted vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deſtroy his owne ſonne, but moſt vnnaturally and moſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13150:23"/> vngodly did it in déede. Neither can they be perſwaded, but that ſo many as fauour any thing at all the righteous cauſe of thoſe that are oppreſſed, and are ſorie to ſée ſuch vnreaſonable crueltie practiſed againſt them (and ſuch eſpecially as profeſſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell themſelues, and are entered into a couenant with it) do all conſpire their ouerthrowe, and ſet vp their owne ſeruants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.

But as for the Prieſts of the Lord, they are euer ſure to pay for it, whenſoeuer any quarell can be pretended againſt them: no regard being had of the multitude, nor of ſuch as are innocent among them, nor how iuſtly any thing they haue done might be excuſed: nor how ſlender an accuſation (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the partie, or thing it ſelfe) is brought againſt them. In what caſe they were in his time, how poore and néedy, he little regarded: and it may be, he did not ſo much as knowe it neither. And yet muſt it néeds be verie apparant, when as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himelech</hi> the high Prieſt had neither ſuſtenance,<note place="margin">21.4.9.</note> wherewithall to releeue a man if neede were, nor ſo much as a weapon for his iuſt defence, but was faine to take of the Shew-bread for the one, and the Sword of <hi>Goliath</hi> for the other, that, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the place it was in, had now bin conſecrated vnto the Lord. This without queſtion he might haue perceiued, and of dutie he ſhould haue amended. But heere he is blind, and ſeeth nothing: and yet in the other he is ſo verie ſharp, that for an hillok he hath quickly found no leſſe then a mountaine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo the <hi>Sauls</hi> of our time are nothing behind. They neuer caſt how to take any good order, for the needfull &amp; honeſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the true ſeruants of God: and likely inough, that they do not ſo much as conceiue, that they haue any ſuch want. But if thoſe ſeruants of God at any time ſlip, if they tread their ſhoe awry neuer ſo little, or, if they haue not offended at all, but only by vniuſt and hard conſtruction: yet if an accuſer may once he found, if any thing may be ſurmiſed againſt them, it is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: by and by they muſt heare, thou ſhalt ſurely dye <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>

If he be in a walled Citie, he is forthwith ſhut vp in their hands, and then muſt they make all the haſt that they can, that they leeſe not ſuch an opportunitie as it. All good deſerts muſt then be forgotten, and either muſt the Lords of <hi>Keilah</hi> falſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him that ſaued them and their Citie, and treacherouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him vp to the hands of his enemies, or caſt their Citie, and themſelues withall, into the perill of preſent deſtruction, <hi>Saul</hi> being ſo furiouſly bent as he was. If we wote not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, yet muſt he be fought for euery day, that ſo in this matter we leeſe no time, but ſo little as may be. If any get knowledge where he haunteth, and how we may come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine our deſired pray, then are they the bleſſed of the Lord, and they forſooth haue compaſſion on vs: and though they be ſuch as could not detect him, but that withall they muſt condemne themſelues to be naught; and to betray the godly, and iuſt, yet muſt ſuch treachery be couered ouer with ſo goodly a name. And if once we be in the chace, and néere to our pray, hardly can any thing turne vs aſide whatſoeuer it be. Neither doth it any thing auaile, though <hi>David</hi> witnes plainly inough his owne integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though our ſelues haue neuer ſo good experience of it, and though for a time our hearts do breake, and teares guſh out, to thinke how vnkindly we haue gone about to take away the life of him, that ſo faithfully hath preſerued ours. It is no more but a morning clowd: and we can no ſooner heare of any other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie offered, but by and by we returne to our former bent, and perſecute <hi>David</hi> as freſhly againe as euer we did. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we may ſeeme to leaue off, ſo long as we ſee not how to preuaile: yet if once we get but ſome glimſe of any good hope, by and by we ruſh vnto it againe, nothing at all regarding how far we miſliked ſometimes our owne doings therein, nor what we promiſed to the contrarie. Not only in labouring for King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but in this quarel alſo, oathes muſt be no oathes with vs now.

Vnto ſome part of the kingdome we finde that he brought him,<note place="margin">Firſt but vnto ſome part of it</note> immediatly after the death of <hi>Saul:</hi> but not to the reſt til <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Saul</hi> was taken away. In the former of which we are to note, how conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient a way he made him vnto it a little before he was to enter, and then how he brought him to the fruition, or vnto the reall poſſeſſion of it. He made him a conuenient way to enter, both in ſuch things as concerned the preparing of <hi>David</hi> vnto it:<note place="margin">What way was made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.

He prepared <hi>David</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, both in preſeruing him from ſuch things as were agaynſt him: and in prouiding him one ſpeciall helpe which made to his purpoſe. Thoſe things that made agaynſt him, were two: one, the perill of his perſon: the other, the hazard of his good name. For the preſeruation of his perſon, the Lord was ſo good and gracious vnto him, that<note n="a" place="margin">27.1.2.</note> when he was afrayd to tarie in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and thereupon fled vnto <hi>Achiſh</hi> (one of the Princes of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi>) the Lord neuertheleſſe gaue him ſafetie there alſo: when as notwithſtanding <hi>David</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">27.8.9.11</note> ſo behaued himſelfe there, that it was great marueile that he brought not himſelfe into greater daunger there, then he was in before in <hi>Iurie:</hi> as after we ſhall haue more conuenient place to declare. The perill that his good name was in, was, for that being now among the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Saul,</hi> and being<note n="c" place="margin">28.2.</note> readie to go to the field with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt

That ſpeciall helpe that it pleaſed God to beſtowe vpon him, and which made ſo much to his purpoſe at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, conſiſted in two principall poynts: wherof the former was<note n="e" place="margin">30.20.</note> a great bootie or pray, which (by occaſion that then fell out) he got from certeyne of the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> the other was a greater power of men that at that time alſo drew vnto him. With his bootie he<note n="f" place="margin">30.26.31.</note> remembred his friends in <hi>Iury,</hi> where he and his men were wont to haunt: to the number of thirteene cities by name, and to certeyne others beſides: a very good preparatiue to make his friends faſter vnto him, now that he was (very ſoone after) to ſtand in neede of their helpe for the kingdome. That greater power of men that came vnto him<note n="*" place="margin">1. Chro. 12.1.22.</note> were diuers of the tribes of <hi>Benjamin, Gad, Iudah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> all actiue, valiant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert men, and meet for the warres. Who are ſayd to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 1.20.</note> at <hi>Ziklag:</hi> but becauſe there is no mention but only of his former ſixe hundred at his returne from the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> therefore it is likely that they came not vnto him, till he was returned thether agayne, and that the ſame was ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Saul</hi> receiued the ouerthrow. At which time comming as they did, they came very fitly for <hi>Davids</hi> purpoſe, now that he was to enter the poſſeſſion of ſome part of the Kingdome. Thoſe others that might bee ſome hinderance vnto him,<note place="margin">Then by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others out of the way, that would, or might haue been ſome hinderance vnto him.</note> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Saul,</hi> and his ſonnes: then alſo as many of the armie beſides, as being that way affected, were there ouerthrowne. That <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf would haue been an enemie to <hi>David</hi> in that quarell, all his doings do ſo fully witneſſe, that wee need not to ſtand vpon that poynt of the matter: and yet ſhall it bee good to conſider more ſpecially, in what manner he, the greateſt enemie that <hi>David</hi> had, and the ſtrongeſt hinderance vnto his kingdom was remooued. The manner whereof reſteth in two principall poynts: one, how he might vnderſtand himſelf to be altogether forſaken now before his death: the other, how he was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly brought to a miſerable end. He might vnderſtand him
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13150:25"/> ſelf to be altogether forſaken, both in the ſtraungeneſſe that he found in the Lord towards him, when (after a ſort) he ſought to haue ſome direction of him what he ſhould do, when now the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> came in agayne ſo ſtrong vpon him: and in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that was giuen by ſuch, as he in that caſe thought good to ſéeke vnto. The ſtraungenes that he found in the Lord towards him, was ſuch, as that now<note n="g" place="margin">28.5.15.</note> in this great daunger approching, and when he was ſo heartily afrayd thereof, and he in this his diſtreſſe<note n="h" place="margin">28.6.</note> ſought vnto him, neuertheleſſe the Lord gaue him<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid.</note> no anſwer at all: neither immediatly, by dreames; nor by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of others, either ordinarie as by <hi>Urim,</hi> or extraordinarie as by any Prophet. And good reaſon it was, that he which<note n="k" place="margin">13.8.13.15.9.</note> twiſe before had made ſo light account of the word of the Lord; and now at this preſent did ſo hotely perſecute <hi>David,</hi> directly agaynſt<note n="l" place="margin">

The Lord ſo eſtraunging him ſelf vnto him, he did not humble himſelf before his face, nor ſo much the more earneſtly ſeeke his fauour: but preſently turned aſide to ſuch as gaue themſelues to ill artes, and ſuch as for that cauſe himſelf had<note n="n" place="margin">28.3 9.</note> before deſtroyed ſo farre as he could. And the anſwer that ſo he receiued was altogether euill:<note n="o" place="margin">28.15.19.</note> that the Lord was his enimie, for that he did not execute his fierce wrath vpon the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> and that now the Lord would deliuer him and his, both his ſonnes and his people into the hands of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims.</hi> Which heauie ſentence was notwithſtanding<note n="p" place="margin">28.19.</note> the next day after<note n="q" place="margin">31 1 7.</note> fully performed. <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">23.17.18.</note> it ſeemeth (of himſelf) would neuer haue moleſted <hi>David</hi> for the kingdome: but fully would haue contented himſelf, to haue been as a friend neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. But yet were it likely, that thoſe that were of <hi>Saules</hi> faction would haue laboured, for to haue ſet him vp agaynſt <hi>David:</hi> or, if he would not, then ſome other of his brethren: as notwithſtanding<note n="ſ" place="margin">2.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was ſhortly after ſet vp agaynſt him. So that this way, though not of himſelf, yet by the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13150:25"/> of others, it was likely enough that <hi>Ionathan</hi> alſo might haue been ſinne hinderance vnto him. As for <hi>Abinadab</hi> and <hi>Malchiſhua,</hi> his other ſonnes,<note n="t" place="margin">31.2.</note> that together with <hi>Ionathan</hi> at that field were ſlaine, they were more likely to haue been an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to <hi>David,</hi> becauſe that as they were the ſonnes of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo do we reade of no ſuch fauour that they bare vnto <hi>David</hi> that were like to ſtay them from encombring of him in that action. Thoſe of the armie that in that quarell or controuerſie held with <hi>Saul,</hi> and with him were there ouerthrowne, would no doubt, if they had liued, haue wrought what comber they could vnto <hi>David</hi> about the kingdome: as afterward alſo thoſe that remayned<note n="u" place="margin">2.8.9.</note> readily did, and therewithall ſhewed what might be feared in the others. That it pleaſed God therefore to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe, we may ſee that thereby he made a readier way vnto <hi>David</hi> to come to the kingdome. To finde out how he brought him to the fruition of it, it is to be noted,<note place="margin">The perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the firſt part of the kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</note> that now that this way was prepared vnto it, and the time was come, wherein God was purpoſed to bring him to ſome part of the kingdome it ſelf, he wrought foorth ſuch things as thereto apperteyned, both in <hi>David</hi> himſelf: and in the whole tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> likewiſe. In <hi>David</hi> now agayne he wrought<note n="x" place="margin">2.1.</note> to ſeeke vnto him for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (both whether it was his pleaſure that now he ſhould enter vnto his kingdome, and where he ſhould begin the ſame) and withall<note n="y" place="margin">2.1.</note> he gaue him direct and plaine anſwer to both thoſe queſtions (willing him now to enter into it, and telling him likewiſe where to begin it) and wrought in him<note n="z" place="margin">2.2.3.</note> to do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. In the whole tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> likewiſe he ſo wrought, that of their owne accord they<note n="*" place="margin">2.4.</note> came and made him their King: at which time <hi>David</hi> was now agayne by them thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted.

                  <p>Divers wayes exerciſing him for a ſeaſon.</p>
               </note> wee are to conſider, that here agayne wee haue noted vnto vs, firſt how it pleaſed God to exerciſe him for a time: and then how it pleaſed him in the end to bring him vnto it. As touching that exerciſe of his in the meane ſeaſon, it reſteth in two principall poynts: one, the ſubſtance or nature of it: the other, the time of the continuance. The ſubſtance or nature of it is ſuch, as hath two principall poynts of hardneſſe: the one, that he was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13150:26"/> kept from the greateſt part of his kingdome: the other, that when opportunitie was offered, as <hi>David</hi> tooke it, to come to his full right therein, although he was readie for to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the benefite of ſuch opportunitie, yet he found that it came to no proofe in the end. He was wrongfully kept from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his kingdome, becauſe that<note n="a" place="margin">2.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was ſet vp by <hi>Abner,</hi> directly contrary to the ordinance of God: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that<note n="b" place="margin">2.10.</note> but one tribe only claue vnto <hi>David,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were drawne vnto <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet no better then a plaine vſurper now. The opportunities that <hi>David</hi> was ſo ready for to haue taken, to haue come to his right thereby, but yet came to no proofe in the end, were two: whereof the one was but only for a part of that which yet ſtood foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt him: the other ſeemed to offer the whole. That which was but only for ſome part of it, was,<note n="c" place="margin">2.4.</note> that the inhabitants of <hi>Iabeſh-Gilead</hi> hauing buried <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2.5.7.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> thereupon taking occaſion to ſend vnto them, to giue them thankes for it, and to aſſure them of a good turne at his hands, if it came in his way, did withall ſomewhat inuite them to take him for their King, as the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> had done alreadie. But<note n="e" place="margin">2.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Abner,</hi> belike fearing that the ſame ambaſſage of <hi>David</hi> was like enough to take effect, if it were not in time preuented, forth-with ſpeedeth himſelf to thoſe parts, &amp; there ſetteth vp <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> to be their King, and to rule not only ouer thoſe two tribes and an halfe beyond <hi>Iorden,</hi> but alſo ouer all the reſt: and ſo was <hi>David</hi> herein preuented. That which ſeemed to offer the whole, was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Abner</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">3.8.</note> being grieued with <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> his Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne (vnto whom he had plight his alleageance) for that he was by him iuſtly reproued for a fault that he made (and yet, it may be, ouer-ſlenderly eſteemed alſo)<note n="g" place="margin">3.12.20.</note> came vnto <hi>David</hi> for to bring the whole kingdome vnto him: being falſe vnto him, whom he had ſet vp a little before.

               <note n="h" place="margin">3.20.21.</note> was content, ſo to haue receiued it, if ſo it had falne out. But God that had determined of a more orderly courſe for <hi>David</hi> to come vnto it, gaue no ſucceſſe to that inordinate way. For <hi>Abner</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">3.26.27.</note> was ſlaine before he could returne to do it: and ſo was <hi>David</hi> in that alſo defeared. The time of continuance<note n="k" place="margin">2.11.</note> was ſomewhat
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13150:26"/> better then ſeauen yeares: during which time<note n="l" place="margin">3.1.</note> the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> were at variance about the Kingdome, and euer among tried their quarell by the ſword.<note place="margin">But then brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him vnto the full fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> How it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to bring him to the whole in the end, hath likewiſe two principall points: firſt how he made him ſome way vnto it, then how he put him in poſſeſſion of it. The why that he made him vnto it, was partly in that which concerned the eſtate of both the Kingdomes generally: and partly in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>David</hi> more ſpecially. That which did concerne the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of both the Kingdoms generally, was<note n="m" place="margin">3.1.</note> that the kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> euer increaſed: and the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> waxed weaker, and weaker. That which concerned <hi>David</hi> more ſpecially, was that he<note n="n" place="margin">3.28.39.</note> made it ſo well knowne, how cleere he was from the bloud of <hi>Abner,</hi> and that many of the contrary part<note n="o" place="margin">5.2.</note> did know that it was <hi>David</hi> (and none other) that was thereunto appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. He put him in poſſeſſion of it, by taking away <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi> that had ſet vp himſelfe againſt him: and putting into the harts of the people now to yeeld their obedience vnto him. <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was taken away<note n="p" place="margin">4.2.5.8.</note> by two of his owne Captaines, (without the conſent, or knowledge of <hi>David</hi>) and, on their parts, in verie ill and treacherous maner: for the which <hi>David</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">4.9.12.</note> put them to death, ſo ſoone as they brought that tidings vnto him. Which being done, then whole <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">4.1.</note> being firſt ſtriken with a great feare, as vpon the death of <hi>Abner</hi> before, ſo now vpon the death of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> alſo,<note n="ſ" place="margin">5.1.3.</note> no all come in (to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of<note n="t" place="margin">1.

            <p n="9">9 If now againe we returne to our ſelues, there may we find that in theſe daies alſo God hath ſuch a worke in hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.<note place="margin">That God hath ſo dealt for the Goſpel likewiſe.</note> It hath pleaſed him alreadie to bring the Goſpel to ſome part of the Kingdome thereunto apperteining: and we truſt that in the end he will bring it vnto the whole. And this we hope ſo much the rather, for that he obſtrueth a much like courſe now as he did before: and, walking as it were in the ſelfe-ſame path, giueth vs before hand to vnderſtand thereby,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13150:27"/> whether he meaneth to come in the end.<note place="margin">That firſt he maketh a way unto it.</note> For firſt we ſee, that he maketh now as conuenient away vnto the Goſpell, and to the ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſt, as he did vnto <hi>David</hi> before: partly in ſuch things as concerne the preparing of thoſe that do aduance the Goſpel, to be the meeter inſtruments to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but eſpecially in remouing out of the way many of thoſe that would be againſt it.<note place="margin">By preparing thoſe that are to aduance the Goſpell.</note> For to the end that ſuch as are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the Goſpell, may be the meeter to do the thing for the which they are ordeined, he preſerueth, not only their perſons to be in a readines againſt the time that they are to be imploied: but their good name alſo in that point of dutie to their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours (for the moſt part of them, though otherwiſe it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, but that ſome particulars may in a great number be found, that by infirmitie haſten thereunto ſomewhat faſter then it were meete that they ſhould.) So likewiſe he putteth into their hands, wherewithall to make them ſuch friends as they neede, againſt the time that they ſhall haue occaſion to vſe them: and ſendeth in vnto them a further power, to help to bring them vnto their right.<note place="margin">And by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others out of the way</note> Thoſe alſo whome he hath remoued out of the way, and daily yet doth more and more, are both ſuch as are the chiefe reſiſters of this ordinance of God: and their adherents together withall. In thoſe that are the chiefe, as they are the greateſt cauſe of offence, ſo may we ſee the hand of God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieſt on them. For we may verie plainly ſee, that the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to giue any anſwer vnto them: either immediatly betwixt him and them, by ſecret inſpiration, or by inclining their hearts to ſuch a courſe, as it were meete for them to walke in, or by the miniſterie of any of thoſe, whome it pleaſeth him in ſuch caſe to vſe. For being deſtitute of the miniſterie that haue their annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Ieſus Chriſt, needs muſt they be deſtitute of <hi>Urim</hi> alſo: and ſo can they haue no anſwer by ſuch. An idolatrous, and a maſſing Prieſthood they haue, that ſtandeth vpon the inuention of man, and vpon their owne vſurpation withall: and for the better credit thereof, they haue an outward kind of ointment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſuch as ſtandeth on no ordinance of God, and therefore is deſtitute of the inward grace without any queſtion. But ſuch a miniſterie as Chriſt himſelfe did leaue vnto vs, and by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13150:27"/> his ſeruants was afterward deliuered vnto the Church, faithfully diſtributing the word of life vnto the people, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues contented there, that is altogether wanting in them, and therefore haue they (in their greateſt affaires) no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by <hi>Urim,</hi> nor by the ordinarie miniſterie of the word. As for that which is extraordinarie, it pleaſeth not God now to vſe the ſame to his children, but very ſeldome: much leſſe to thoſe that are without. For they haue deſtroyed the Prieſtes of the Lord, with all the crueltie that can bee deuiſed: and that for no fault at all on their parts: but only vpon pretenced quarels, and cauſeles furmiſes of their owne. And as the Lord doth in this ſort before hand, by ſuch eſtraunging of himſelf from them, giue them to vnderſtand, how much he is offended with them (and iuſtly too:) ſo may we ſee, that in the end likewiſe he taketh them away in ſuch ſort, as may well betoken his diſpleaſure therein alſo: and many of them, in as miſerable and deſperate manner, as he tooke away <hi>Saul.</hi> For as in the end he ſpared not himſelf, whom <hi>Davids</hi> hands ofttimes had ſpared before: ſo many of thoſe, that in theſe dayes of ours haue been principall doers, in the perſecuting of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and contriuing treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries agaynſt thoſe that profeſſe it, being often ſpared before, by thoſe that iuſtly might haue been reuenged of them for thoſe their trecheries, haue at the length layd hands of themſelues: and ſo the iuſt iudgements of God, that others in compaſſion and pitie would not, themſelues haue executed in moſt deſperat manner vpon themſelues. Among the adherents of theſe wee may ſee likewiſe, that not only ſuch, as of whom there was no better hope, are taken away: but alſo that ſome of our <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> likewiſe, are wrapped vp together with them in the ſame iudgements: ſuch I meane, as though they did beare good will themſelues to the Goſpel of Chriſt: yet ſome way or other were ſuch notwithſtanding, as by whom the courſe of the Goſpell might haue been hindered. But what may thoſe that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hope for, when as ſuch as (for their owne parts) are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friends, are notwithſtanding by God himſelf ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued: &amp; yet for no malice in them; but for that by ſome other circumſtance they might be offenſiue to the kingdom of Chriſt.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13150:28"/> Which courſe, if wee ſee that the Lord hath at any time taken, wee neede not to doubt, but that now he meaneth to haue the kingdome of Chriſt more fully aduanced, when as wee ſee that he doth ſo much remooue whatſoeuer offences are in the way. We may ſee likewiſe,<note place="margin">Then that he hath given in ſome good meaſure, the thing it ſelfe.</note> that he hath not only made away vnto it, but that alreadie he hath in ſome good meaſure aduanced that kingdome of his among vs. For as then he did put into the heart of <hi>David</hi> to ſeeke vnto him, and wholly to referre himſelf to his direction; and then ſtirred vp the whole tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> to receiue him likewiſe: ſo now in like manner he hath both put into the hearts of diuers Princes to ſeeke the Lord, and to take their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of him; and withall hath ſtirred vp many, therein to yéeld their alleageance vnto them. But as then it was no other tribe among them all, that at the firſt did ſo readily yeeld to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>David,</hi> but only the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> whereof <hi>David</hi> him ſelf came, and which had the greateſt promiſe of ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: ſo now likewiſe we finde not, that all generally receiue the Goſpell, at leaſt not ſo readily when the ſame is firſt preached vnto vs; but that it is only thoſe that are of the ſpirituall linage in Chriſt, and to whom God hath vouchſafed (in thoſe things that apperteyne to the kingdome of God) a more ſpeciall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then otherwiſe he hath done to many others. This being done,<note place="margin">That we are in ſuch ſort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed before.</note> before that God bring all the whole generally vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the ſcepter of Chriſt, wee may finde likewiſe, that God is diſpoſed to exerciſe vs, euen as he exerciſed him before: both in reſpect of the nature of that his exerciſe, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the continuance alſo. For as touching the nature of it, diuers hopes and likelihoods are likewiſe giuen to thoſe that do earneſtly wiſhe the aduauncement of the kingdome of Chriſt, which notwithſtanding come to no proofe in the ende. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſeemeth, that when ſome haue yéelded their obedience alreadie, others thereupon might bee more eaſily perſwaded to come in alſo. But that courſe can no ſooner be taken, but that ſome <hi>Abner</hi> or other will quickly croſſe it, and in no wiſe ſuffer <hi>Iabeſh-Gilead</hi> to come in ſo ſoone. And they on the other ſide may well be readie, and very forward to do ſuch a poynt of ciuil duetie, as to commit the bodie of <hi>Saul</hi> to buriall: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13150:28"/> bee nothing the néerer to any ſincere loue of the Goſpell. Inſomuch, that as <hi>David,</hi> when he ſawe that noble minde in them, thereupon belike conceiuing good hope, that they might eaſily haue been induced to his alleageance, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding deceiued therein: ſo wee likewiſe may be as farre to ſeeke, if where wee finde in ſuch ciuill dueties ſo heroicall mindes, wee hope that they alſo might ſoone bee wonne to the Goſpell of Chriſt. It is very true, that (for the moſt part) of baſe mindes little good may be looked for to the kingdome of Chriſt: and that our beſt hope (for ſuch matters) lieth in thoſe that are more nobly minded: which alſo, it may be, was a good ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſe, why ſo many Capteynes and Souldiers (who for the moſt part are more nobly minded, at leaſt if it be their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that hath brought them to that kinde of life) are found in the Bible, but eſpecially in the new Teſtament, ſo readily to haue imbraced the trueth, and to haue ioyned themſelues vnto the profeſſors of it. But yet in ſuch alſo may we bee often decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if we relie ouermuch vnto it. Sometimes agayne there is hope conceiued, that if <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> fall out, and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> thereupon bee purpoſed to reuoult, and to reduce the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>David:</hi> then will the matter be ſoone at an end, and that it muſt needes bee a ſure and a readie way, to put <hi>David</hi> in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the whole. But that courſe alſo doth not finde ſo good ſucceſſe in the ende, as to fleſh and bloud it might ſeeme that it would. God is moſt honorable in all his doings: and though ſometimes he turneth ſuch deuiſes to good in the end, yet to thoſe that awayt him in godly patience, he layeth foorth (in his good time) more orderly meanes to atteyne to the thing that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: eſpecially when the matter concerneth the aduancement of his kingdome here on earth. As for the time it is not ſo much as to be expected, that the Goſpell ſhould by and by be ſpread abroad ouer all. As it had a time to come to ſo low an ebbe, as in theſe dayes of ours we haue found it to be at: ſo muſt it haue a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to get vp to that heighth that we would gladly wiſh to ſee it in, if ſo it might ſtand with the pleaſure of God.<note place="margin">And that the likelihoods are great, that the Goſpell is ere long to bee much more aduanced.</note> But as <hi>David</hi> after that he had reigned ouer one part only for the time, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward brought vnto the whole: ſo our truſt is, that our <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:13150:29"/> alſo that now ſtand out, will at length remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and with one conſent ſubmit themſelues vnto the ſcepter and kingdome of Chriſt. Their leaders they may find, although that they be the contrary partie, yet to bee innocent of the bloud of all ſuch <hi>Abners,</hi> as oppoſing themſelues agaynſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, haue iuſtly falne (but not by the hand, or conſent of <hi>David</hi>) into the like iudgements of God. At leaſt though men be ſo ſubiect vnto their owne infirmitie, and ſo caried away ſometimes by their affections, that euer in ſuch poynts all can not be ſo fully excuſed: yet thoſe alſo are ſo free herein, that any reaſonable man may hold himſelf therein contented; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thereof wanteth in man, that is fully ſupplied by Chriſt. For he came not into the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might bee ſaued: and ſo is there no man that needeth to doubt, but that he is abſolutely free from the bloud of all. Neither may theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of ours ſee only that <hi>David</hi> is free from the bloud of ſuch <hi>Abners,</hi> as otherwiſe of themſelues, or by the hands of others haue iuſtly periſhed: but alſo that it is he that ought to reigne, and that is ordeyned of God to bee their King. Of which they haue ſo euident proofe, both in the word, and many other wayes beſides, that we need not to ſtand vpon it: eſpecially if the compariſon bée betwixt thoſe baſe ordinances of man which they would haue ſo highly aduanced; and the excellencie of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, vnto whom all power is giuen, in heauen, in earth, and alſo in hell. If therefore the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by ſuch things in <hi>David</hi> induced to make a couenant with him, and to yeeld their alleageance vnto him: how much rather may theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of ours be induced therby, to make a couenant with Ieſus Chriſt, and to yeeld themſelues to his kingdome? For if <hi>David</hi> were free from <hi>Abners</hi> bloud, and if he were ordeyned of God to bee their King (as in trueth he was) and if the matter were ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in him, that now they all did playnlie perceiue it: much more muſt thoſe things be in Chriſt, and in his Goſpell, in farre greater meaſure without compariſon; and ſo conſequently much more euident alſo in him. And ſo it is not to bee doubted, that how farre of ſoeuer theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of ours, do yet ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13150:29"/> Chriſt and his word: yet is there a time which God hath appoynted when as they ſhall miſlike their folly, and with one conſent make him their king, that ſo he may enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole. For if the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo effectually touched (at the length) to yeeld vp their obedience to <hi>David,</hi> that they came with ſo great a number, and thoſe the principal men of them al, and with the conſent of all the reſt: it may not bee doubted, but that Chriſt alſo, &amp; his eternall trueth ſhal haue the ſame in ſome good time performed likewiſe. And ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> was but a figure, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt is the trueth it ſelf, ſo much the rather may we hope, that as wee ſawe the glorie of Chriſt at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> a great deale greater then was this of <hi>David</hi> at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in of al the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> ſo we may now alſo atteyne to ſée the like general aſſent in ſome good time yéelded to the Goſpell of Chriſt, by the ſtates &amp; people of Chriſtendome, that in ſome good meaſure may proportionably anſwer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable patterne that we haue ſeene alreadie in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But ſo beeing come to good opportunity to treat of the hope that we may conceiue of this matter, that is,<note place="margin">What courſe it is, wherein we may iuſtly conceive this hope afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide.</note> of a further accompliſhment of the kingdome of Chriſt by his worde, we are to conſider, firſt what is the courſe wherein wee may conceiue the hope aforeſayde: then howe to aunſwere that which may ſeeme to goe againſt it. Concerning the former of theſe two, we are to knowe, that if wee woulde exactly haue it, we are to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, not onely out of this booke of the hiſtorie, but alſo out of all ſuch <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as belong vnto this compaſſe of time. But becauſe the hiſtorie will be ſufficient for this matter, and more agreeable vnto the order that hitherto we haue obſerued, we ſhal holde our ſelues contented therewith: and yet, becauſe that out of thoſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> we may learne, howe to exerciſe our ſelues to good purpoſe in theſe our troubles, in the end wee ſhall conſider of thoſe alſo, both to ſee how <hi>David</hi> exerciſed him ſelfe therein, and how we may doe the like our ſelues. Keeping our ſelues therefore, but vnto the hiſtorie at this preſent, wee are there to marke, what is the courſe that <hi>David</hi> held in theſe matters: and then, how wee may in theſe dayes of ours, apply the ſame vnto our ſelues. In the courſe that <hi>David</hi> helde in theſe matters, we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13150:30"/> are to conſider, what minde he caried, firſt towardes God: and then towards others.<note place="margin">What mind David caried towards God. Seeking after ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> Towardes God wee may finde that hee bare a very good minde ſo ſoone as euer this perſecution was rayſed agaynſt him: and in the courſe of all his dealings after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo. For at the firſt, ſo ſoone as euer perſecution was rayſed againſt him, hee being forced to ſteppe aſide to auoid the preſent daunger, forthwith got him to the godlier ſort: firſt vnto <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Ramah,</hi> and then vnto <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt. Vnto<note n="a" place="margin">19 18.</note> 
               <hi>Samuel</hi> hee came when <hi>Saul</hi> had miſt of him<note n="b" place="margin">19.10.</note> himſelfe, and thereupon preſently<note n="c" place="margin">19 11.</note> ſent vnto his houſe to ouertake him there, and to diſpatch him. Whereupon being driuen to ſaue himſelfe by flight, he tooke his courſe to <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, there (belike) in this diſtreſſe to ſeeke ſome comfort in the Lorde. Shortly after vnderſtanding more fully by the helpe of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> was fully bent to deſtroy him, being then occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned again to ſaue him ſelfe by flight,<note n="d" place="margin">22.1.</note> he came to <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt: belike to worſhip the Lorde there, and to ſee what comfort ſo he might finde, in this his perillous and troubleſome caſe. And as thus he began, when perſecution was firſt raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſo held he on, in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of his dealings beſides. For wheras <hi>Abiathar</hi> one of the Prieſts and ſonne to <hi>Ahime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> eſcaping that great &amp; cruell ſlaughter that <hi>Saul</hi> did make of al the whole company of the Prieſts at <hi>Nob,</hi> for his ſafetie and ſuccour came vnto <hi>David,</hi> althoughe it were a dangerous matter for him, to giue any entertainment vnto him: beeing ſo far in diſpleaſure himſelfe as he was: yet<note n="e" place="margin">22 23.</note> did he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, but (ſuch loue bare he to the Prieſts of the Lorde) he willed him alſo to be of good comfort, and told him plainly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> with him he ſhould not miſcary ſo far as he ſhould be able to help.<note place="margin">Ever inquiring of the Lord, in all his great and doubtfull affayres.</note> And hauing ſo gotten one of the priſtes of the Lord vnto him, accuſtomably in his waighty affairs he aſked conſel of the Lord: that ſo he might be able to direct his waies the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the good liking and pleaſure of God. As for example, when word was brought him that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Keilah</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">23.2.</note> he aſked counſell of the Lord whether he ſhould goe againſt them, or not. At which time although the Lord bad him go, yet becauſe that his company made further queſtion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13150:30"/>
               <note n="g" place="margin">23.4.</note> he aſked the Lord of the ſame point agayne, and agayne recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſame aunſwere of him. So likewiſe during the time that he was at <hi>Keilah,</hi> after that hee had deliuered them from their enimies, hearing that <hi>Saul</hi> was determined to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and then wiſely premeditating with himſelfe in what daunger he was like to bee, if the Lords of <hi>Keilah</hi> would not ſtand faſt vnto him, although in reaſon he might haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that after ſo good deſerts of his: hee needed not to doubt of any of them, eſpecially ſo very ſoone after: yet knowing how eaſily he might be deceiued, if he ſhould reſt ouermuch in men, there againe<note n="h" place="margin">23.10.12.</note> he ſought to the Lord, to know in deede, whether <hi>Saul</hi> would come thither, and if he came, whether the Lordes of <hi>Keilah</hi> would deliuer him and his men into his hands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Lord aunſwered, both that <hi>Saul</hi> would come in deede: and that the Lordes of <hi>Keilah,</hi> notwithſtanding his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, would deliuer him, if there he taried, into his handes. In like manner, when at his returne he found <hi>Ziklag</hi> ſpoiled, and his ſouldiers in their impatience were about to haue ſtoned him<note n="*" place="margin">30.6.8.</note> he in this diſtreſſe pluckt vp his heart, and again aſked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lord, whether hee ſhoulde followe on thoſe that had done it: and whether that voyage ſhoulde bee proſperous vnto him. And ſo, receiuing aunſwere to his deſire, hee ſet in hande with the voyage, and not onely recouered all they had loſt: but alſo gained much more vnto it. Afterwarde againe when worde was brought him, that <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſonnes were ſlayne in the fielde, ſo that nowe the kingdome was deuolued vnto him, and the time came that he was to enter into the poſſeſſion of it (in which caſe there are not many, of the moſte godly that theſe dayes) haue that would awayt any playner or further calling yet would he in no wiſe take that courſe, or be ſo bolde as to ſtep one foote towardes it, vntill the time that he had<note n="i" place="margin">2. Sam. 2.1.</note> firſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Lord: both whether it was his pleaſure, that now he ſhoulde make any entrie into the kingdome, and in what city he ſhoulde begin. But being aunſwered in both theſe pointes, he them foorthwith addreſſed himſelfe to doe accordingly. It may be alſo that when hee was with <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> hee did there likewiſe, by the miniſtery of <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> aſke counſell of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13150:31"/> Lord: both becauſe that<note n="*" place="margin">22.10.</note> 
               <hi>Doeg</hi> doth ſo charge <hi>Ahimelech</hi> and becauſe that<note n="*" place="margin">22.15.</note> 
               <hi>Ahimelech</hi> doth net deny it. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee haue no mention in the Text it ſelfe, that ſo hee did. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Ahimelechs</hi> aunſwere doth wel import, that at other times before he had done it: &amp; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it was an vſuall exerciſe with <hi>David,</hi> ſo to doe. Neither did hee onely thus religiouſly hang on the Lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Obeying the Prophets of the Lord.</note> but alſo on a time<note n="k" place="margin">22.5.</note> when the Prophet <hi>Gad,</hi> but one of the ſeruauntes of the Lorde came vnto him, willing him not to abide in the holde (which for a time he had taken in the land of <hi>Moab</hi> for his owne ſafety, and with the Kinges good licence therein firſt obteined) but to returne into <hi>Iury</hi> againe, him alſo in this point hee redily obeyed. And yet was it, but ſuch as wee terme a matter of ſtate, and in reaſon, full of daunger, and ſo conſequently no good aduice: neither doth the text declare, that it was the worde of the Lorde, but onely that the Prophet did will him ſo to doe.<note place="margin">Longing after the Sanctuary.</note> Neither was he ſo deuoutly giuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence God himſelfe and his ſeruauntes, but euen the place it ſelfe of Gods worſhip, and the aſſembly of the people of God were ſo dear vnto him, that<note n="l" place="margin">26.19.</note> he ſpecialy complained of the want therof vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> as the greateſt, and moſt grieuous part of al his troubles: as<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 84.3.</note> elſwhere alſo he doeth very grieuouſſlye complaine of that matter, not vnto <hi>Saul</hi> (who might thinke it to be nothing els but of oſtentation) but to God himſelf apart from men, that in that point his eſtate was ſo miſerable, that the eſtate of the birds of the ayre,<note place="margin">What minde he caried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. Towardes his enimies.</note> that might approche the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the Lorde, was better then his. How good a minde he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to others, may likewiſe appeare two ſpeciall wayes: firſt and principally by his dealing with his enimies, but partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his dealing with others beſides. His enimies that nowe we ſpeake of, who were the cauſers of theſe his troubles, were (to make account of) none other but <hi>Saul</hi> for his time: and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Abner</hi> the generall of his army. Againſt all which he ſo defended himſelfe, that neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he neuer ſought, by any yll meanes to take away them, ſo to eaſe himſelfe of his troubles the ſooner. For his own neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iuſt defence, we finde, that<note n="n" place="margin">18.11.19.10.</note> euer he tooke diligent heed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13150:31"/> vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> that he did him no diſpleaſure on the ſuddayne: and that<note n="o" place="margin">18.14.30.</note> wiſely he behaued him ſelfe in all his wayes. Then alſo, not deſpiſing the helpe of others, ſuch as it pleaſed God to offer vnto him, we finde likewiſe that<note n="p" place="margin">22.2.</note> he tooke ſuch aydes as came vnto him of their owne accord, though otherwiſe many of them were ſo infamous and baſe, as many (of a nice kind of holines) would haue diſdayned: and both<note n="q" place="margin">20.5.8.</note> vſed the help of <hi>Ionathan</hi> his friende, and<note n="r" place="margin">23.18.</note> renued his bond of amity with him. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any euill practiſe againſt any of thoſe his enimies, firſt as touching <hi>Saul,</hi> we finde that he ſpared him<note n="ſ" place="margin">24.3.7.26.7.11.</note> twice, when as not onely himſelfe might haue done it very eaſily, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his owne perſon, or ſhedding any mans bloud beſides, but alſo, if hee woulde but haue ſuffered them, others woulde haue done it for him: and that, when as without his knowledge one had deſtroyed him in the fielde, and brought him word of it, hee<note n="t" place="margin">2. Sam. 1.2.16.</note> both auenged the death of the one with the death of the other: and beſides that<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. 17.27.</note> mourned heartily for him. As for the others, he likewiſe both<note n="x" place="margin">3.31.35.</note> mourned for <hi>Abner,</hi> and<note n="y" place="margin">4.9.12.</note> auenged <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheths</hi> death y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hough theſe had hitherto kept a great part of his kingdome from him, and nowe that theſe were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, hee mght well perceiue, that it muſt needes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come all to his handes. Thoſe others beſides, with whome <hi>David</hi> is founde heere to haue dealt ſo well, are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtraungers, or thoſe that were further of from him: and partly his friendes, or thoſe that were neerer vnto him:<note place="margin">Towardes the oppreſſed.</note> Of the former ſort we may account the Citizens of <hi>Keilah:</hi> and ſuch of the country, as among whome he ſoiourned. With the Citizens of <hi>Keilah</hi> his dealing was, that although<note n="z" place="margin">23.3.</note> hee was in diſtreſſe himſelfe, and it was daungerous for him to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen where hee was: yet<note n="a" place="margin">23.5.</note> both readily hee came to their helpe, and valiantly deliuered them alſo. With thoſe others of the countrie among whome hee ſoiourned, howe hee dealt,<note place="margin">Towardes thoſe among whome he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned.</note> wee haue it not ſo playnely ſet downe. But ſo farre as one ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may be ſome helpe to gather it, and one circumſtaunce of likelihood beſides, we may well conceiue that he dealt very wel with them. That one ſtorie that I ſpeake of, is of his good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towardes <hi>Nabal:</hi> by whome while he ſoiourned,<note n="b" place="margin">25.7.15.21.</note> hee did
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13150:32"/> not ſuffer his ſouldiers to pray vpon him, or to take any thing from him (thought<note n="c" place="margin">25.2.3.</note> he were but a churle, and very wealthy) but moreouer<note n="d" place="margin">25.16.</note> was a wall or defence vnto him and to all that hee had, both day and night againſt any that would. So that if this were his manner of dealing with others alſo by whome hee ſoiourned, no doubt it was maruellous good. That cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunce of likelihood that I doe meane, is, that when he got that bootie from the <hi>Amalekites</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">30.26.31</note> hee did ſo friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member many of his friendes, and about thirteene Cities by name, where hee, and his men in time of their diſtreſſe were wont to haunt. For ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> ſhewed ſuch friendſhip to them be like they ſhewed, when he was among them, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to him. But it is not likely, that they woulde ſhewe him any ſuch friendſhip if hee had liued on the ſpoyle among them. Whereas on the other ſide if hee dealt with them, as hee did with <hi>Nabal,</hi> and when hee had neede, made his moane vnto them to obteine ſuch helpe at their handes, as hee might with their fauour: then was there no reaſon, but that, if there were any good nature in them, they muſt needs both help him for the time ſo well as they coulde, and euer after alſo bee friendly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Thoſe that were more neare vnto him, were his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and thoſe his friends that nowe wee ſpeake of. His ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<note n="f" place="margin">30.22 15.</note> hee did not defraude of a liberall portion of the pray they had taken,<note place="margin">Towards his ſouldiers.</note> and when there were of the company that woulde haue allowed nothing to ſome of their fellowes that for<note n="g" place="margin">33 10.21.24.</note> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe taried behinde, and thereupon were left to keepe their ſtuffe, hee woulde not ſuffer them to bee defrauded of any part of their portion neither. Of his friendes alſo wee ſee, that hee reteined ſo thankfull remembraunce, that ſo ſoone as God ſent him wherewithall to remember them,<note place="margin">Towards his friends.</note>

And in trueth, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that the vaine pleaſures of the worlde are otherwiſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt to fleſh and blood, and that not onely to the children of the world, but alſo in ſome meaſure to the children of God: yet notwithſtanding, whenſoeuer wee are in diſtreſſe, in ſuch ſort that in any good meaſure wee are humbled thereby, and that wee finde kindely indeede, that the worlde doth hate vs, and and wee are fallen out with the worlde agayne, or, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth vtter it, that we are crucified to the worlde, and the worlde vnto vs, then is there nothing ſweeter, than in ſuch caſe to flee to the Lorde, neyther is there any ſound comfort, but onely in him, then the heart doth gladly preaſe to the ſoyle, and neuer can reſt till hee come there. The children of the worlde do in ſuch caſe ſeeke, to ſome worldly comfort or other: but it is becauſe they knowe no better. And ſeeing that ſuch hauock is already made of the ſeruauntes of God (by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtate of long, and by the confederates thereof yet) that ſkantly haue they left vnto vs ſome one <hi>Abiathar,</hi> or other, that hath ſaued himſelfe by flight (in compariſon of thoſe, that otherwiſe the church of God might haue enioyed, to their great and ſingular comfort) what coulde bee more ſeemely for the <hi>Davids</hi> of our time, thoſe Princes I meane that profeſſe the Goſpell, then to receiue into their protection ſuch <hi>Abiathars</hi> as are eſcaped? wherein coulde they better expreſſe their zeale towards God, wherein may they take a better courſe for them ſelues? For <hi>David</hi> hauing <hi>Abiathar</hi> with him, now vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion had oportunity (and oft times did accordingly vſe it) to inquire of the Lord what he had to doe: when the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> inuade <hi>Keilah,</hi> and when <hi>Saul</hi> doth caſt to ſurpriſe him, when his owne City is ſpoyled, and himſelfe in peril to bee ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13150:33"/> for it, when hee is to goe to his kingdome, and where he is to make his entrie. And (no doubt) by theſe <hi>Abiathars</hi> of ours, our <hi>Davids</hi> alſo may in all thinges vnderſtande, what is the good will and pleaſure of God, in whatſoeuer it is that they haue to doe. Where that annointing is, there the Lorde will aunſwere by <hi>Urim,</hi> there is no queſtion. And bleſſed be God, that as he vouchſafed that mercy to <hi>David,</hi> in that his diſtreſſe to ſend vnto him ſuch an <hi>Abiathar</hi> with the <hi>Ephod</hi> with him, as by whome hee might bee ſafely guided in all his actions, in thoſe troubleſome and daungerous affayres: ſo nowe alſo hee hath prouided our Princes likewiſe of the ſelfe ſame helpe, by ſuch as he hath to the ſelfe ſame vſe of his goodneſſe preſerued from all ſuch maſſakers as heeretofore haue bene of the Lords ſeruauntes, when as by the wicked it was intended, vtterly to haue deſtroyed them all, if by any meanes they coulde haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it. And ſeeing that ſo good oportunitie is offered, of ſo ready and ſure aduice, farre be it from any of our <hi>Davids,</hi> that any of them ſhoulde ſo much forget, or ſo little eſteeme ſo good an helpe,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 6.3.16.</note> as not take the benefiet of it. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> him ſelfe, and all the Princes and Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and generally the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beſides (whome <hi>Moſes</hi> did a little before ſo much aduaunce for vnderſtanding and wiſedome,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.6.8.</note> in reſpect of thoſe moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and excellent lawes that were giuen vnto them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Lorde was in all things ſo neere vnto them, and ſo preſent with them in all their affayres) were notwithſtanding notably ouer-reacht by the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> when as they inquired not of the Lorde what they were to doe in that matter, vpon a wrong ſuppoſall, that themſelues had already eſpied the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of it.

Much like hereunto it is, that he did ſo eaſily yeelde to the Prophet <hi>Gad,</hi> in ſo great a matter as it was vnto him: and it were much better for many of vs likewiſe, to giue eare to our Prophetes (ſuch as wee finde to be of the Lorde) than otherwiſe to runne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13150:33"/> the courſe that wee doe. Let all things be done by the rule of the worde of God, and it is the thing, that, for this matter, is the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſte that can bee deſired. In which word the more that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body is faythfully and effectually exerciſed, the meeter is hee (if other things want not) to ſuch a purpoſe: and our Prophets (except their calling) are nothing meet or then any others (by the ordinary courſe of Gods dealing with vs nowe) but onely ſo farre, as in this point they haue the aduantage, and there by are better inabled then others are. The leſſer that Princes them ſelues are exerciſed in Gods holy word, the vnlikelier they are to gouerne their affayres by the leuell thereof: and the vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier they are themſelues to doe it, the more doe they neede to haue the helpe of thoſe that can. And, for the moſt part, wee ſee it to be the maner of God; that giuing the ſoueraignty or ſtroke vnto one, direction and counſell hee giueth oft times more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to others. In his want that he felt in that his baniſhment of the exerciſe of religion, in that thereby he was kept from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and from the publique worſhip of God, as it ſheweth a notable good diſpoſition in him, ſo may it teach as like wiſe, howe precious a treaſure wee ought to account it, to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the Temple of God: and euer to haue a part in thoſe thinges that there are done: but in the publique ſeruice of God, and for our owne inſtruction beſides. And the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we may finde it to bee our manner, that the greater we are, the more doe we for the moſte part abſent our ſelues from thoſe aſſemblies, and either breake vs (for our honour, or eaſe) vnto our priuate chapels at home, or altogether abſent our ſelues from all places of publique worſhip, the more needefull is it, that wee ſhoulde remember what <hi>David</hi> was in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: a man of great honour and calling, imployed about great and waighty affayres, and ſo deepely in daunger of his life for a long time nowe, that hee had ynough to one, to keepe him ſelfe from the iawes of death: and yet complayning moſte of this, that he was kept from the houſe of the Lord, and from his inheritance there. In the mind that he caried towardes others,<note place="margin">What minde to carie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others.</note> &amp; firſt towards his enimies we find that although he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his owne ſafety: yet againſt them might hee neuer vſe any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13150:34"/> euill practiſe. Out of his care for his owne ſafety wee alſo may learn to take this leſſon, not only that it is lawful for ſuch, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues againſt vniuſt violence: but alſo that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that ſo they ſhould. It is meet that we take good heede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Sauls</hi> of our time in any of their mad moodes do vs not ſome diſpleaſure on the ſudden: it is meete alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we behaue our ſelus wiſely in al things, ſo much the rather, for that the enimy doth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly await al ſuch occaſions, as wherby he may be able any way to annoy vs, &amp; ſo to come to any part of his deſire. And as for ſuch helps as draw vnto thoſe, that in ſuch caſe are now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, it may be alſo that ſome-times they are ſuch, as of whom in ſome reſpects they might be aſhamed: &amp; yet in no wiſe to bee refuſed, being ſuch as the Lord thinketh good to ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt himſelf hath none other, we are, ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather, for to content our ſelues with the like: eſpecially, when as we may hope, that he that giueth ſo few, &amp; ſimple at the firſt, wil at length giue mo and better, as we ſée that heere-tofore he dealt with <hi>David</hi> himſelfe. If God alſo vouchſafe (of his goodnes) to beſtow any <hi>Jonathans</hi> on vs, ſuch as will deale faithfully for vs, and themſelues are deſirous and readie to be in league with vs: it is our parts again, both to vſe their help as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, &amp; not to refuſe to be in league of friendſhip with ſuch. But as we may vſe ſuch lawfull meanes for our owne defenſe: ſo muſt we take heed, that we lay no violent hands on any of the Lords annointed; ſuch I meane, as are his annointed to vs, and vnto whome we are none other but meere ſubiects. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if God at any time bring them into our hands, and neuer ſo eagerly bent vpon vs: yet are we to know, that they are not therefore brought into our hands, that we ſhould take them at that aduantage; but that by ſparing them, we ſhould declare, how much we abhor to ſéeke our own ſafetie or peace by inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wayes. Neither are we to content ourſelues, only to bear them no heauier minds, but that we can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to ſpare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but alſo to beare them ſo ſound good will, as that we do in hart deteſt any violence done vnto them; and vnfeignedly mourne when their eaſe is ſuch as any way deſerueth to be lamented. Then alſo comming to others, we are to haue that care of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13150:34"/> hard eſtate or diſtreſſe of others, that although we be in hard caſe our ſelues, yet ſhould we be ready if it lye in vs, to help ſuch others as are in néede. If any of theſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> of ours, come and ſpoile any <hi>Keilah</hi> of our neighbours adioyning, though we haue buſines inough of our owne, yet if it be in vs to help thoſe diſtreſſed neighbours of ours, we may not ſlip from their iuſt defence in time of néede. But being in armes, then are we eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for to take heede, that we and our companie be not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to thoſe among whom we abide, or by whom we paſſe as occaſion ſerueth. Better a great deale, ſo to vſe them, that both we may do our ſelues good, and ſtill they may be our faithfull friends, then by ill dealing to make them our enemies, and to hurt our ſelues withall. A rule that is ſo little regarded with vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we are in armes, that lightly we do more hurt to our neighbours and friends in lying by them, then to our enemies in warring vpon them. Our ſouldiers alſo are much forgotten, and haue their due inter-cepted by thoſe that are their leaders. Though euer we ſend them foorth like men, yet ſeldom find we, but that they are beggars when they returne. But, beſides that is no wiſedom, ſo hardly to vſe ſo néedfull helps, it is iniurie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and great oppreſſion, ſo far to defraud thoſe that lay downe their liues in our quarell: and the greater that the cauſe is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we are to imploy them, the more doth it aggreuate, whether our folly, or elſe our fault, wherewithall in this caſe we are to be charged. As for our friends, I truſt, I néede not ſpeak for them: but ſure it is, that if they be not from time to time wel remembred, as abilitie and opportunitie ſerueth: and that, not only that ſo we may the better keepe them to our own benefit, but alſo of the inward and vnfeigned thankfulnes of the heart: we are in great ieopardie with God, that ſeethe our in-moſt thoughts, iuſtly to leeſe, thoſe that we do ſo looſely keepe. In both theſe therefore, if we regard to hold on that courſe that <hi>David</hi> did, or but in needfull maner to help forward the cauſe it ſelfe that we haue in hand (which as we know is of more price, then to be haſſarded by the want of either of theſe) we muſt be liberall vnto the one, and thankfull alſo vnto the other.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That which may ſéeme to go againſt that hope of ours
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13150:35"/> that expecteth a further accompliſhment of theſe things to vs,<note place="margin">That this goodnes of God towards David, was not founded on Davids ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</note> is the difference that is ſuppoſed to be, betwixt <hi>David</hi> to whom it was performed before, and all thoſe is whom the application that we haue made doth ſéeme to promis the ſame now. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which difference, firſt it is to be knowne, that though ſuch a difference there be, yet may it not aboliſh this hope that we ſpeake of: and then are we more ſpecially to examin, what is the difference that is betwixt vs. That although ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there be, yet is it not to aboliſh the hope that we ſpeake of, may ſufficiently appeare, for that ſuch mercie of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs is not meaſured forth vnto vs, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our deſerts, but ſo far-forth as he in his wiſedome is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for to aduance his honor among vs. For if the caſe be of that nature, that the worthines or vnworthines of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be not reſpected, then, though the difference that is betwixt vs were much greater then it is, yet may it not bar vs of that hope,<note place="margin">That God is purpoſed of himſelfe, euer more and more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs: and that thence ariſeth great hope unto us.</note> that in ſuch caſe may ariſe vnto vs. But thus rather we are to gather, that the Lord is ſo fully purpoſed, more and more to ſhew or open himſelfe to the world, that he will ſtill hold on that courſe of himſelfe, not reſpecting whether thoſe on whom he beſtoweth ſuch further manifeſtation of his glorie, deſerue it or not. And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he doth oftimes withall auenge himſelfe with great ſeueritie, on many of thoſe that do receiue the grace of God in vaine. Howbeit for this time it ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for vs to conſider, how we may find him to hold this courſe, that euer as the world groweth néerer to the conſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and ſo conſequently the full aduancement of the kingdome of God the more approacheth: ſo doth he likewiſe more and more aduance his glorie on earth, not reſpecting the deſert or worthines of thoſe that liue, whether they were better or worſe then thoſe that were before, or after in their ſeuerall times do follow. This may we ſee in the whole courſe of the world generally: and in both thoſe ſorts of people, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with whome it pleaſed God to deale more ſpecially.<note place="margin">This to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, in the whole courſe of the world generally.</note> In the whole courſe of the world generally we may behold, that he was much more gracious vnto the world, when he choſe vnto him one people among them all, and beſtowed the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13150:35"/> Law vpon them: then, for the ſpace of two thouſand yéeres al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he was to thoſe that liued before, among whome he choſe to himſelfe no one people, ſtock, or familie that we do reade of, but only a few ſeuerall perſons, on whom alſo he beſtowed no ſuch knowledge, as afterward he did on thoſe others. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when afterward he vouchſafed to enlarge the kingdome of God to all nations, and to their better inſtruction to beſtow the Goſpell vpon them, we may plainly perceiue, that heerein he was much better to the world now, then he was before vnto it: for that now he hath taken in all nations indifferently, and giuen vnto them the truth it ſelfe, whereas before he tooke but one, and gaue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but figures alſo. But ſhall we therefore ſay, that thoſe ages that haue ſuccéeded, are better then thoſe that were before? Or may we not herein plainly perceiue, that he in ſuch caſe doth nothing reſpect, either the worthines, or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of thoſe on whom he beſtoweth ſuch mercies, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that himſelfe at all times doth, euen as he in himſelfe hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined? To come to the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his dealing with the Iewes</note> that firſt were choſen the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people of God, <hi>Abraham, Izhak,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob</hi> had but the promiſes made: but their poſteritie, in proces of time, had the accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all thoſe promiſes. The people that came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> periſhed in the wildernes: but thoſe which followed came into the land of promis. <hi>Moſes</hi> could but ſée it from the top of a mountaine, a far off: but to <hi>Joſhua</hi> was it giuen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, to make a conqueſt of it, and to diuide it vnto the people. For a time they had in a maner but a popular ſtate: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they grew to a Kingdome. At the firſt they had but the Law: but afterward had they the Prophets alſo. Chriſt was for a time but verie obſcurely propounded vnto them, by thoſe figures and ſhadowes of the Law: but afterwards, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Prophets, a great deale more plainly opened vnto them. The glorie of the firſt Temple was verie great, but could not in any wiſe compare with the latter. The Kingdome of Chriſt was much aduanced among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by his own prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and works, while he was on the earth among them: but nothing like to that which afterward folowed, by the miniſterie of the Apoſtles, when himſelf was taken vp from among them.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13150:36"/> Should we therefore hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prefer, before <hi>Abraham, Izhak,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iaakob,</hi> that imbaſed poſteritie of theirs that after followed, <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Diſciples of Chriſt, before Chriſt himſelfe? Or ſhould a popular eſtate, be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Kingdome: the former Temple, before the latter: the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and ſhadows of the Law, before the plainnes &amp; truth of the Goſpel? Yet ſo muſt it be, if God ſhould haue beſtowed thoſe greater bleſſings according to the dignitie of the perſons: or if he held not a ſet courſe to make his goodnes more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly knowne to thoſe that follow after, then vnto thoſe that went before.<note place="margin">In his dealing with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> Among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> we may ſée the ſelfe-ſame courſe obſerued alſo. For though there were not many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the firſt got into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Chriſt, yet a while after they were innumerable, though for a time they were excedingly hated, and vnder moſt bitter perſecution, yet ſhortly after they were hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all, and enioied the faith in peace. After which time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of thoſe Churches were caried away with error againe, and in thoſe which remained, the truth of God was verie much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted alſo, according as the ſcripture foreſhewed before, and as the ſinne of the world had iuſtly deſerued. Whereupon God in mercie diſpoſed to call back certain of thoſe Churches againe vnto their former faith in him, and to that end raiſing vp to the world notable men, mightily furniſhed with his holie ſpirit, although we find that vnto them and to many others of his people then he gaue a notable light: yet find we alſo, that the light which he gaue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was far inferior vnto that which now he hath giuen forth to many others, otherwiſe far inferior vnto them. In which caſe we are not in deſerts or worthines to prefer thoſe that follow, vnto thoſe that were before, as though that God for that cauſe were ſo much better to them, becauſe he found them better then others, but euer to aſcribe all to the meere goodnes of God, nothing at all in ſuch caſe reſpecting whether men are worthy or not, whome euer he ſhould find, without queſtion, to be of themſelues as void of all deſerts and woorthines, as could be deuiſed. But thus rather we are to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that as the Sunne, the neerer it is to his riſing, the more light it ſpreadeth forth on the face of the earth: ſo Chriſt alſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13150:36"/> the Sonne of righteouſnes, the néerer that he is to aduance his glorious Kingdome, vnto that fulnes that is due vnto it, and that the faithfull are put in hope once to behold, the more doth he increaſe his comfortable bleſſings in the meane ſeaſon, that ſo we may be ſo much the better prepared thereunto, againſt the time that he ſhall beſtow that fulnes vpon vs. Among all the men of the world that euer were, are, or ſhalbe (Chriſt only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) there is not one of that deſert or worthines in him-ſelfe before God, that might procure any ſuch ſpeciall bleſſing of him: nor, till God him-ſelfe of ſpeciall fauour hath otherwiſe wrought it, not one of vs all, any thing better than any other. The enlarging of his goodnes vnto the world, is altogether his owne, and none of ours: it proceedeth nothing at all from vs, but altogether, and only from him.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But now more ſpecially to examin what is the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that is betwixt vs, we are to conſider,<note place="margin">That on Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids part, there is no ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt him at that time, and the children of God ſince.</note> whether it be ſuch as may iuſtly import, that although God were ſo gracious to him, yet is there no cauſe for vs to thinke, that well may he be as graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vs. But the truth is, that we find no ſuch difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, as maketh any odds for this matter: whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but thoſe things only, that concerne his owne perſon, or the occaſion, whereupon it pleaſed God to bring him to the Kingdome. For if we reſpect thoſe things that concerned his owne perſon, the euent it ſelfe will plainly declare, that he had not all thoſe mercies of God beſtowed vpon him, ſo much for himſelfe, as for the people whom he was to gouerne. Inſomuch that whether <hi>David</hi> were without his infirmities, or not, and thoſe that on the behalfe of the Goſpell were to be aduanced now, had their infirmities many and great, yet were not ſuch odds betwixt the perſons of any ſuch force, as might bar vs of the hope before deſcribed. But it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had his infirmities: and that as he notwithſtanding other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had good cauſe to await the full accompliſhment of thoſe great mercies that God had begun to beſtowe vpon him, ſo we alſo haue ſuch reaſon for vs, as that in like maner we may looke to enioy a further manifeſtation of the Kingdome of Chriſt, that in ſome meaſure alreadie is aduanced among vs. The infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13150:37"/> of <hi>David</hi> (ſuch as belong to the compas of time that now we ſpeake of:<note place="margin">Of Davids in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</note> for we are not in this caſe to ſearch any further) are of two ſorts: ſome of them ſuch, as in ſome ſenſe might be excuſed: others againe ſo apparantly euill, as in no wiſe may be defended.<note place="margin">Such as in ſome ſenſe might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</note> Thoſe that in ſome ſenſe might be excuſed, do moſt of them ariſe out of the troubles that he had in hand: but one there is, that was nothing at all (ſo far as we read) occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby. Thoſe alſo that aroſe out of his troubles, are ſome of them belonging to that compas of time wherein <hi>Saul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe liued: one to the time of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> his ſonne.

If it were a breach of the law of God, then do not thoſe words of Chriſt tend to excuſe him: but only to put them in mind, how themſelues might he able to find, how great their malice was towards Chriſt and his Diſciples, that could ſo eaſily put vp that in <hi>David,</hi> and ſo hardly exact this of them. As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 8.3.7.</note> adultereſſe was brought vnto him, and he willed that whoſoeuer he were among them that was without ſin, he ſhould caſt the firſt ſtone at her: he did not therby excuſe her lewdnes, or made no reckoning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law, of God, but himſelfe not medling to be her iudge, rebuked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo that they were ſo prying into other folks ſinnes, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of then owne. But his fact might verie well be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie alſo, and ſo no breach of the law of God, nor to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among his infirmities, if we could any way be certaine that ſo it were: ſuch as that<note n="f" place="margin">Nomb. 25.7.8.</note> knowne fact of <hi>Phinehas</hi> is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken to be: and ſuch as was that fact of Chriſt himſelfe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13150:37"/> (as he came in the forme of a ſeruant) when he<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 2.14.17 Math. 21.12.13.</note> ſcourged the buiers and ſellers out of the Temple. For ſo it pleaſeth God ſometimes ſo thoroughly to ſeize vp to holie vſes, and ſo fully to poſſeſſe the children of God, that in their zeale they are caried beyond the bounds that the Law preſcribeth: and yet in no wiſe to the impeachment or derogation of the Law preſcribed to all. In which ſenſe whether <hi>David,</hi> in that want of other victuals did it, or not: yet do thoſe words of our Sauiour teach, that the ſame fact<note n="h" place="margin">Math. 12.2.</note> which the Phariſes miſliked in the Diſciples might be of that kind, for ought that they did knowe to the contrarie, and that ſuch an other they had long before in <hi>David</hi> himſelfe. And ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> was a man ſubiect to infirmitie as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, and ſeeing that it is not vnlikely, but that theſe words of Chriſt may rather ſhewe, in what ſenſe <hi>David</hi> might haue done it well, then preciſely in what ſenſe it was done in deede: therefore it remayneth that this alſo might come of his infirmitie, and ſo be gathered to that account.<note place="margin">Taking agayn the ſword of Goliath to his private vſe.</note> As touching his ſword, it<note n="i" place="margin">Pet.

If ſo he had, then was there<note n="k" place="margin">Leui. 27.28.</note> a law, that nothing altogether ſeparate vnto the Lord, might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne be taken to common vſe.

In the former of them, for that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned forces now, eſpecially ſo infamous as many of them were: in the latter, for that he could not be ignorant, but that the Lord had caſt away <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; rayſed him to gouerne in his place;

In his demeanour while he was there we find,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13150:39"/> that he did not only<note n="y" place="margin">27.8.9.11</note> deale very ill with certeyne of the people of thoſe quarters (the <hi>Geſhurites, Girzites,</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi>) deſtroying man, woman, and child, leauing none to complayne of his doings; and, the better to couer his doings from <hi>Achiſh</hi> his friend,<note n="z" place="margin">27.10.</note> deepely diſſembled the ſame vnto him: but alſo that<note n="a" place="margin">28.2. &amp; 29.8.</note> he was content and readie, to go to the field vnder <hi>Achiſh,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> his owne countrimen and the people of GOD,<note place="margin">That hereby may appeare, that our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities alſo can not iuſtly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his good hope in us, of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie he hath begun.</note> and agaynſt the King his maiſter.

Which that we may the better perceiue, we need to conſider but theſe two things: in how ill eſtate the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, when he came vnto it: and how ſlenderly he ſet in hand to redreſſe the ſame. That the common wealth of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13150:39"/> 
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in ill caſe,<note place="margin">The hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of Iſrael, when Saul came to it.

How much they were ouerlayd by gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſeruitude, may likewiſe appeare, both for that the text it ſelf doth plainly ſay it: and by other vndoubted tokens that there are found. The text it ſelf doth plainly ſay it, for that it telleth vs<note n="a" place="margin">13.6.</note> that at that time the people were in great diſtreſſe. Thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vndoubted tokens thereof are two: one, how the people at that time demeaned themſelues: the other, what want there was of ſuch warlike furniture as was conuenient. The peoples demeanour at that time was, that they had not the heart to looke their enemie in the face, but that ſome of them<note n="b" place="margin">13.6.</note> hid themſelues in caues, and in holes, and in rockes, and in towers, and in pits on that ſide of <hi>Iordan</hi> that was next to the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers agayne did leaue that part of the countrie, and<note n="c" place="margin">13.7.</note> went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Iordan</hi> vnto the land of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſo to bee farther from the daunger of them. The want that they had of ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like furniture as was conuenient, was very great: both for that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> did not ſuffer any<note n="d" place="margin">13.19.</note> Smith or Cutler to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, by whom they might haue had ſome weapons made (no<note n="e" place="margin">13.20.21.</note> not ſo much as for their inſtruments of huſbandrie, but either muſt carie them to the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> to bee mended or ſharpened there, or els might not haue but only the helpe of the file at home) and for that among all the people that followed <hi>Saul</hi> to withſtand the enemie (which alſo were but very fewe, but only about<note n="f" place="margin">13.15.</note> ſixe hundred in all, when the others were gone that<note n="g" place="margin">13.8.11.</note> gat themſelues away for feare) there<note n="h" place="margin">13.22.</note> was not ſo much, as either a ſword, or a ſpeare found, but only with the King him ſelf, and his ſonne. That the people to whom they were ſubiect were idolatrous, and directly contrary to them in religion,<note place="margin">And thoſe idolatrous.</note> is moſt apparant, not only for that they were none of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and enemies vnto the people of God: but alſo for that the text doth make particular mention, both of one ſpeciall Idol that they worſhipped; and of their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous dealing agaynſt the true and liuing God. That one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13150:40"/> ſpeciall Idoll that they worſhipped, was<note n="i" place="margin">Iud. 16.23</note>

Their blaſphemous dealing agaynſt the true and liuing Lord, doth not only appeare in their deliuering vp of the Arke of the Lord<note n="m" place="margin">5.2.</note> into the Temple of their Idoll <hi>Dagon,</hi> as though that their Idoll had been the better, and that by his power they had then preuayled agaynſt the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but alſo in that <hi rend="sup">n</hi>

For certeyne it is that ſomewhat he did, and ſuch as might beare a reaſonable ſhew: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, his doings being better conſidered, he did in a manner nothing at all.<note place="margin">That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he did.</note> That which might beare ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhewe, was firſt on behalfe of ſome part of the people: then afterward ſomewhat that he did on behalfe of them all.

               <hi>Iabeſh Gilead,</hi> one of the the Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Iorden,</hi> which <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> had ſtrongly beſieged, and when the Citizens ſued for peace, he would in no wiſe graunt it vnto them, but vpon a very cruell and diſhonorable condition: which was, that he might thruſt out the right eye of euery one of them, and ſo bring a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vpon them, and vpon the whole nation withall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the ſpirit of the Lord comming vpon <hi>Saule,</hi> he ſent foorth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13150:40"/> his meſſengers to commaund the people forth-with to followe; he quickly got a great number together; made haſte to <hi>Iabeſh;</hi> rayſed the ſiege; and gaue a notable ouerthrowe to the enemie. Inſomuch that whereas before certeyne euill perſons made light account of him, which alſo was eaſily put vp of the reſt, now were the people generally ſo farre in loue with this their new King, that had not <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf ſtayed them, needes would they haue had thoſe ill perſons to haue been ſought out, and for that their former contempt to be put to death now. That which afterward he did on behalfe of them all, was ſome part of it of his owne accord: and ſome part agayne, by the direct comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. Of his owne accord both he did ſomewhat at the firſt entrie into his kingdome: and afterward he proceeded ſomewhat further alſo. At his firſt entrie into his kingdom both<note n="p" place="margin">13.2.</note> he choſe out 3000. men to haue in a readineſſe vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (two thouſand to attend vpon himſelfe, and the other thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand on <hi>Ionathan</hi> his ſonne:) and<note n="q" place="margin">13.5.</note> when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> now began to inuade them agayne, he did not only<note n="r" place="margin">13.35.16.</note> addreſſe himſelfe to giue them battaile: but alſo when as<note n="ſ" place="margin">14.1.15.</note> by other meanes they were diſcomfited, he<note n="t" place="margin">14.20.</note> followed vpon them and gaue vnto them a great ouerthrow. That which ſomewhat after he did, was in effect no more but this, that he did his endeuour (in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to deliuer his countrie from their enemies. Which thing is deliuered vnto vs by two ſpeciall poynts: one, how he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſuch as were meet for the warres: the other, in what ſort he dealt with the enemie. Concerning the former,<note n="u" place="margin">14 52.</note> it is ſayd that he made much of them. Concerning the latter, it is ſayd firſt generally, that<note n="x" place="margin">14.47.</note> not only he did ſtill warre vpon them on euery ſide (and that<note n="y" place="margin">14.52.</note> right ſore agaynſt the <hi>Philiſtims</hi>) but alſo that he<note n="z" place="margin">14.4.</note> euer put them all to the worſe, and did<note n="a" place="margin">14.48.</note> much rid his people out of the hands of thoſe that ſpoyled them. More ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially there are numbred among them, not only thoſe of whom we haue ſome ſtorie ſet downe, as the <hi>Ammonites, Philiſtims,</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> but others alſo of whom we haue no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtorie, as the <hi>Moabites, Idumeans,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi> That which he did by the ſpeciall commaundement of God, was his expedition<note n="b" place="margin">15.1.9.</note> agaynſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> at ſuch time as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13150:41"/> God was diſpoſed to be auenged on them for an old iniurie, that almoſt 400. yeres before they had done to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as in the Wilderneſſe they were paſſing on to the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In which expedition although he did not execute the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God agaynſt them, ſo ſtrictly and fully as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to do: yet<note n="c" place="margin">15.7.8.</note> made he a great deſtruction of the enemie: and beſides that,<note n="d" place="margin">15.6.</note> had a ſpeciall care of the <hi>Kenites,</hi> certeyne auncient friends of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to get them out of the way,<note place="margin">But, that it was nothing to ſpeake of.</note> that they periſhed not with the other. That yet (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe goodly ſhewes) he did in a manner nothing at all, it appeareth in this, for that the Lord doth flatly reiect him for the want that he found in him. Which want of his was of the chiefe and principall matter of all: that is, of an heart, or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpoſe, in al things to awayt the Lords direction, and then to frame his doings thereafter. For ſeeing that now he was choſen to bee King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, both to ſuſteyne the perſon of God among them, and to gouerne them, not as his owne, but only as the people of God: how could he but ſee, that now of neceſſitie he muſt needes reſigne himſelfe vnto God, euer to ſeeke his direction of him, and in all things to do as he ſhould appoynt? That ſo he did not, we haue deliuered vnto vs by two examples, that playnlie declare how ſhort he was in thoſe two poynts: one, in that<note n="e" place="margin">13.9.</note> he awayted not the comming of <hi>Samuel:</hi> the other, in that<note n="f" place="margin">15.9.</note> he did not execute the ſentence of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> with that ſeueritie that was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In both which notwithſtanding we may ſee that he grewe ſo néere to his full duetie in thoſe two poynts, that a reaſonable man would thinke, he had done very well; and yet in trueth he came very ſhort of that which he ought to haue done in deede. For as touching the former of them, that is, the awayting of <hi>Samuels</hi> comming, the ſtorie is this, that <hi>Samuel</hi> promiſed to come thether vnto him;<note n="g" place="margin">10.8.</note> both to inſtruct further what he ſhould do, and<note n="h" place="margin">11.14.</note> to renew or eſtabliſh the kingdome vnto him, with the generall conſent of all before the Lord: and therefore willed him there to abide till he came vnto him,<note n="i" place="margin">10.8.</note> naming in deed but ſeauen dayes, (after the manner of their kinde of ſpeach) but yet not meaning any determinate number, but that if he thought he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

This platforme being layd forth vnto him, now are wee to ſee how néere it is that he ſeemeth to come vnto it: and how farre in trueth he commeth ſhort of it. He may ſeeme to come néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, both in that he taried ſo long as he did: and in that he had ſo good cauſe as he had, then to breake vp. He taried<note n="k" place="margin">13.8.</note> vntill the ſeauenth day: and, as it ſeemeth, vntil the time of the euening ſacrifice of that day: it may be alſo, that he taried fully the ſeauen dayes outright: and ſo conſequently, altogether ſo long, as the Prophet (in ſtrict letter) required of him. The cauſe that himſelf alleadgeth, why he was ſo bolde as to breake vp then, was<note n="l" place="margin">13.11.12.</note> for that the people began to ſteale away apace: and ſeeing that the enemies lay ſo neere as they did, he thought he might ſeene bee driuen to encounter with them: and that he would bee loath to do, before he had ſacrificed vnto the Lord. But it may bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſeeing he was<note n="m" place="margin">10.6.9.10. &amp; 11.6.</note> before endued, in ſome good meaſure, with the Spirit of God, and his kingdome ſo much eſtabliſhed as<note n="n" place="margin">11.12.</note> before it was (both by his victorie againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and for that the people there, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that occaſion accepted of him) he was now perſwaded, that neither he needed any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Prophet, nor any further inauguration by his miniſterie before the Lord: eſpecially at ſuch a time, when as thoſe other conſiderations (in reaſon) required ſuch haſt as they did. Short he came<note n="o" place="margin">13.13.14.</note> for that he awayted not that further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that further renewing or eſtabliſhing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to him before the Lord: notwithſtanding that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet taried ſo long as he did: and notwithſtanding thoſe reaſons he had ſo much to haſten. Now as touching the latter of them (wherein his doings do lye more open, than in the other) he might ſeeme to haue gon very néere to the Lords commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that he<note n="p" place="margin">15.8.9.10.</note> deſtroyed ſo much as he did: and for that the reſidue that they did not deſtroy, yet<note n="q" place="margin">15.15.</note> brought they away, and to<note n="r" place="margin">15.15.</note> offer in ſacrifice vnto the Lord. But yet was he ſhort,<note n="ſ" place="margin">15.18.19.22.23.</note> for that vpon his owne reaſon, and the liking of thoſe that were with him, he did not execute the ſentence of God to the vttermoſt poynt that was commanded: and withall turned vnto the pray, or greedily ſought ſome aduantage therby.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13150:42"/> (and much rather of meaner eſtates) to deale with them, after that by their ſlacknes before, they had now got the bridle into their téeth. As for any furniture againſt the wars, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, but that they ſwept all as cleane from vs, as euer the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> did from them?

And if any of vs thought much, in thoſe things to be ſo beholding to them, or would not take the paines to ſeeke ſo far, they had laid the coaſt ſo ſure in all ſuch caſes, that what we were loath to take of them, we were ſure but hardly to find any where elſe.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13150:43"/> And as a man may eaſily geſſe why thoſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> allowed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to haue no weapons, nor any to make them: ſo is it as eaſie in theſe daies alſo, to ſay what the cauſe is why ours likewiſe allow not the people to haue the Scriptures among them, nor any to ſhew vs what they require, or to leade vs into the knowledge of them. They pretend, and boldly beare the peeple in hand, that the Scriptures are both hard, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: but the truth is, they would keepe vs in bondage ſtill, and therefore can they in no wiſe allowe vs to haue our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.

And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding though ſo they do: yet vnleſſe they euer put them to the worſe likewiſe, in that point muſt they needs come ſhort of <hi>Saul.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted of any, but that diuers of our Chriſtian Princes there are, that by the vertue of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and in reſpect of iuſtice it ſelfe, alreadie haue exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and daily yet do, the iudgements of God againſt all our <hi>Amalekites</hi> whatſoeuer, that heretofore haue bin ſo offenſiue, or yet are, vnto any of the people of God, that at any time paſſe from the bondage of ignorance, error, or ſin, by the wildernes of this preſent life, vnto the land of eternall promis, the kingdome of God: who being poſſeſſed with a ſpeciall care on the behalfe of all that are friends to the people of God, do neuertheleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the enimie with a mightie deſtruction. Theſe things no doubt at leaſt in ſome meaſure, are found among our Chriſtian
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13150:44"/> Princes: and needs muſt they make, whereſoeuer they are, a great good ſhew of performing all that is required.<note place="margin">But the chiefe thing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. A full reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> But then as in <hi>Saul</hi> the chiefe was wanting: ſo is it likely, in this caſe to be with vs likewiſe. For although they acknowledge that God hath called them thereunto, and that they are to gouerne in his name: yet are there not many, that altogether reſigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto him, and fully determin or ſet down with themſelues, than in all their waies they will be haue themſelues, as thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the perſon of God, and as thoſe that haue the managing or gouernment, not of their owne, but only of his. Seldome is it ſeene, that in all things they purpoſe, and fully determin, euer to await the direction of God, and they is frame their doings according. Such an inward ſound reſolution is far to ſeeke in many of them. And as the compas of ſcripture that now we are in, ſheweth the ſame to be wanting in <hi>Saul,</hi> but only by thoſe two ſpecial points before rehearſed: ſo we likewiſe ſhall neede none other to find the ſame alſo to be wanting in vs. For there are not many, that in ſuch caſe would await the comming of the Prophet to inueſt them further in their kingdome, and better to inſtruct them what they ſhould do: neither can they find in their hearts in ſuch ſort to puniſh certaine offendors, as God hath commanded that they ſhould.<note place="margin">Awaiting the Prophet.</note> As for awaiting the Prophets comming, becauſe it was (in one point eſpecialy) but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, and peculiar to that caſe, therefore do they take no part thereof to belong to themſelues. For though it were in that caſe méete, to haue the miniſterie or help of the Prophet to his further inauguration at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> in a publike aſſemblie of the people: yet doth it not follow thereupon, that there is any vſe of ſuch help in their caſe alſo. It was meete for <hi>Saul,</hi> for that as yet he was not fully inueſted in the Kingdome: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he was before<note n="d" place="margin">10.1.</note> annointed by the Prophet at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">10.17.24.</note> choſen by lot before the Lord in <hi>Mizpeh,</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13150:44"/> election, ſhewing vnto them who it was, whome the Lord would haue to be their King: and though he were ackowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and accepted of the people at <hi>Iabeſh-Gilead,</hi> yet<note n="k" place="margin">11.7.8.12.</note> was it but of a part of the people, only of thoſe forces that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt the <hi>Ammonites</hi> (and yet to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 330090.) And becauſe all this was no full eſtabliſhing of the Kingdom vnto him, therefore was he firſt to awaite a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolemnitie of inauguration in ſome general aſſemblie of al, and wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie of the Prophet was verie conuenient. Many of ours would haue thought, much leſſe then thus much to be ſufficient: eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſo vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t occaſion ſhould make them to haſten to enter into it, without ſo perfect inauguration. And yet <hi>Saul</hi> as it ſeemeth, did not of any greedineſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo haſten his entry (for he awayted the Prophet ſeuen dayes, as before is declared) but onely for that hee tooke himſelf to bee very iuſtly called vnto it, or rather by ſtrict neceſſitie ſtrongly vrged. And as for inſtruction not many of vs, if in our iudgement our title were good, and ſo readie a way layde open vnto vs, woulde haue thought that a ſufficient cauſe to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayted the Prophet ſo long: eſpecially if our ſelues before had receiued the ſpirite of prophecie<note n="l" place="margin">10.10.</note> as hee had done, and if wee had at that preſent<note n="m" place="margin">13.5.</note> ſo weighty matters in hande beſides. For it is the manner with vs, eyther altogether to ſhut out the Prophet, from all our aduices and councelles in ſuch matters, euen of contempt or inwarde diſlike that wee haue to ſuch a courſe: or at leaſt, vnder pretence of our owne ſufficiencie, if ſo bee that wee haue any meaſure of knowledge: or elſe vpon euery ſlight and eaſie buſineſſe, to holde our ſelues as iuſtly hindred. As for the other, that is,<note place="margin">Puniſhment of offendors, ſuch as God appointeth.</note> in ſuch ſort to puniſh offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors as God appoynteth, that is ſuch a matter, as hardly can wee frame our ſelues in diuers cauſes to come any thing near. Inſomuch that although <hi>Saul</hi> were in this point ſo maruellous ſhort, that chiefly for that cauſe hee caſt him away: yet if wee conſider that caſe of his, wee may finde that hee went much nearer to that which the Lorde did appoint him to doe, then wee in ſuch caſe were like to haue done: whether wee reſpect the nature or ſubſtaunce of that caſe it ſelfe: or certayne cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13150:45"/> thereunto appertaining. Vnto the nature of the caſe it belongeth to conſider that it was an execution: and the ſame very ſeuere. If wee haue to deale in an execution, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmonly we think, that ſome worke of mercy doth much better become vs. If it taſte of ſeuerity, though neuer ſo iuſt, yet, if much it ſtande thereupon, as in this caſe it did (beeing<note n="n" place="margin">15.3.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to deſtroy both the people themſelues, and all that did belong vnto them, both man, and woman, infant, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Oxe, and Sheepe, Camell, and Aſſe, and to haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of them, and all this, for no cauſe elſe, but onely for that<note n="o" place="margin">15.2.</note> certaine aunceſters of theirs long before layde wayte for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the way, as they came vp from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed with them) then doe wee ſeeke to giue it the ſlippe ſo much as we can, and euer lightly do but ſliue it when we haue any ſuch thing to doe. The circumſtaunces are two: one of the time: an other of their perſons. As for the time, it was almoſte 400 yeares ago, when that fault was made that nowe was puniſhed, And this execution was to bee done, when firſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his kindgome. As for their perſons, the time it ſelfe ſufficiently prooueth, that they were not the offendors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: but their poſteritie, very neare to the tenth generation. And yet notwithſtanding although hee ſpared ſome, the Text it ſelfe doth beare him witneſſe, that, thoſe excepted,<note n="p" place="margin">15.8.</note> hee vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed all the people with the edge of the ſworde: and himſelfe addeth further, that<note n="q" place="margin">15.15.</note> hee deſtroyed all the reſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee reade that hee ſpared any thing, for any benefite to himſelfe or his people, but<note n="r" place="margin">15.15.22.</note> onely to offer them in ſacrifice vnto the Lorde: though <hi>Samuel</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">15.19.</note> doth tharge him, that in that caſe alſo hee did no better then turne to the pray: and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wickedly before the Lorde.<note place="margin">How much the rejection of Saul ought to touch our Chriſtian Princes.</note> But, O mercifull God, if <hi>Saul</hi> in thy iuſtice deſerued for this to be caſt away, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnmeete to ſitte in the throne of thy iudgement on earth: howe iuſtly haue our Princes alſo deſerued to bee remooued, and to giue place to the worde of thy power, that trueth and equity may be eſtabliſhed, and ſet vp for euer!

And what though nowe it doe repent many of them, that they haue ſet vs goe ſo much as they haue? what, though hearing that we are ſometimes intangled in ſome wilderneſſe of theirs, thereupon they come foorth againſt vs with a freſhe power, either to bring vs back into bondage againe, or elſe to put vs all to the ſword? Is it of neceſſity that becauſe they woulde ſo haue it, therefore it muſt bee ſo in deede? Can they in no wiſe otherwiſe take it,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13150:48"/> but that if once we bee entangled, then are they ſure to preuaile agaynſt vs?

For when God woulde haue brought vs in, wee made light account of it, and did not beleeue his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towardes vs: wee woulde needes haue ſearchers to goe and ſee, whether it were ſo good a lande, and whether we ſhould bee able to get it. God had already told vs, both that it was a notable land, and that hee woulde giue it vnto vs: but that woulde not ſerue. If men of our owne choyce did not tell vs ſo too, wee thought it no wiſedome, ſo ſoone to yeelde vnto the bare worde of God alone: and wee were not aſhamed, to put to his triall euen the trueth of God himſelfe, and to make him to ſtande at our barres, and there to bee tried by the verdict of lying men. What reaſon therefore, but that, hauing done ſo great diſhonour (or vilany rather) to the God of all trueth and glorie, wee ſhould iuſtly hee excluded for a time from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable fruition of this land of promis that nowe wee would ſo fayn enioy. But ſeeing that wee the children of thoſe our great aunceſtours haue ſo long beene kept out, and borne the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our parentes refuſall, what letteth but that nowe, when wee ſee that God beginneth to perfourme his mercies towards vs, wee may hope that the time of that wrath of his is almoſt expired, and that nowe hee is willing and reedie to bring, vs in, and to put vs in full poſſeſſion? If wee alſo haue had our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites</hi> and <hi>Midianites,</hi> that haue buſily ſought to infringe our peace, and to make, a breach into the good eſtate that God hath giuen vs, and haue hiered their <hi>Balaams</hi> againſt vs, if not once or twice, but verie often they haue aſſayed, by ſecrete pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes to doe vs ſome miſchiefe: If they haue multiplied their maſſes againſt vs, and neuer ſo often reiterated that ſacrifice of theirs which they call vnbloodie, but yet is bloddy and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in deede: muſt wee therefore doubt, that ſometime or other they ſhall preuayle, and that the Lorde will caſt vs head-long downe, into that inſatiable gulfe of their blood-thirſtineſſe? Or many wee not rather hope, on behalfe of the quarrell that wee haue in hande, that as at that time he confounded all their deuices, and made fruſtrate all their attempts, and turned the cruell and deadly curſing that they had intended, into a ritche

And if wee coulde open but the eares of our mindes by fayth, no doubt wee might finde, that euen in their ſecrete corners among themſelues, many of them haue ſuch ſpeaches one with another, complaining of their own ruinous ſtate, and ſetting it downe for a verie truth, and that themſelues do looke for no other, but that in this cauſe we are ſo bleſſed of God himſelf, as that their curſings can take no place, but that the cauſe we haue in hand muſt ſtill preuaile, and that their impugning of it can be of no force, but againſt themſelues. Not long ſince we graunt, that a few of them did verie often and very eaſily put to flight many of vs: and, if any ſtood againſt them, they eaſily bereft them of their libertie, lands, and life. But thoſe were the daies of the heauie wrath of the Lord: and the time as then was not come, wherein God meant to ſhew forth his power on their behalf.

But when now the time was come, the Prieſts that bare the Arke of the Lord, could no ſooner by the commandement of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſtep into the riuer, and but profer to make their entrie, but that by and by (a wonder to ſee) the waters parted and gaue them paſſage on dry ground.

Neither can it bee denied but that in theſe dayes there are not a fewe that do beare it ſuch a good will, as that thereby thou haſt made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it (in theſe ſecondarie meanes with vs) a readier way to come to the height that is due vnto it. For not only the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13150:51"/> do in many places beare good will vnto it, and leauing the glorie of a thouſand to <hi>Saul,</hi> aſcribe no leſſe then ten thouſand to it: but many <hi>Ionathans</hi> alſo there are, whoſe hearts thou haſt in ſuch ſort touched, that they haue it in ſo great, not eſtimation only, but euen admiration alſo, that al they can do is too little for it. Neither their furniture, nor abiliments of honour are ſo deare vnto them, but that it muſt haue them all: and though it be their owne father that would do it any diſhonor, or hurt: yet can they not ſuffer it at their hands neither, but ſtill preuent it ſo much as they can. And whereas yet there are many likewiſe, that are enemies vnto it: yet doth not that enmitie of theirs proceede of other occaſion, then that of <hi>Saul</hi> did agaynſt <hi>David;</hi> nor yet is proſecuted in other manner. For what other thing is there, that ſo kindleth their hearts agaynſt the Goſpell, but only the ill temper that is in them, and for that they playnlie ſee, that it is the thing that thou art diſpoſed now to aduance: and that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and their looſe regiment muſt now come downe, and giue place vnto it? And that it might the better be knowne to bée of the ſame nature that the other was of, how doth it proceed after one and the ſelfe ſame manner: firſt in ſecret, and openly after; and yet very rageous not only agaynſt <hi>David</hi> himſelf, but alſo agaynſt many others for his ſake, euen as their furie therein doth leade them? A thing that though themſelues perceiue not, yet is it to vs, and to all that are able to ſee, a ſufficient matter whereby to decipher, both what it is they do impugne, and who they are that do impugne it. We ſee likewiſe and muſt needes acknowledge (and as to our comfort we do behold it, ſo do wee right gladly acknowledge it alſo) that notably thou haſt begun alreadie to aduaunce thy Goſpell among vs: that thou haſt made it a readie way, by preſeruing, encreaſing, and ſtrengthning thoſe, by whom it pleaſeth thee to aduance it: and that thou haſt alreadie ſubdued many countries and kingdomes vnto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſame, and much weakned diuers of thoſe that ſtand agaynſt it. In <hi>Hebron</hi> thou doeſt already reigne, ouer the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> thine owne kindred: and though <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for many of them) do as yet ſtand out agaynſt thee: yet thoſe alſo haſt thou weakened much, and daily encreaſeſt in ſtrength agaynſt them.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13150:51"/> But O Lord ſuch is thy maieſtie, and ſo worthie art thou to rule ouer all, that not only thoſe that are neereſt vnto thee, but the fartheſt alſo, euen to the vttermoſt ends of the earth, ought to yeeld their obedience to thee. True it is that in <hi>David</hi> we found very good things, and ſuch as might well commend him to vs, vnto the place that thou at the length didſt call him vnto: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, a ſpeciall good regard to thy will, and a delight in thee and thine: and towards others, a very good heart, not only to his acquaintance and friends, but euen to ſtraungers and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies alſo. But whence had <hi>David</hi> theſe, but from thee? In him they were but in ſome meaſure: and, in compariſon, but in ſmall portions neither: in thee they are immeaſurable, and in greater aboundance, than can be conceiued. He was but a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard at the firſt: though it pleaſed thee after to make him a King. The baſenes of his eſtate before, might be no hinderance at all vnto him, to his further aduancement when the time was come, wherein thou diddeſt meane to beſtowe it vpon him. Thy Sonne our Lord, hath been, thou knoweſt, a Shepheard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: he diſdayned not to abaſe himſelfe vnto it: and he ſtucke not for any traueile or paines, that did apperteyne to the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it. And ſhould he not haue as readie a way thence to the kingdome, as <hi>David</hi> had? Or could the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai</hi> bee ſo aduaunced: and ſhall not the eternall Sonne of the Father, the God of all power and glorie, and to whom only al kingdom and maieſtie doth only belong, haue as readie a way vnto it? Our ſelues, we graunt, by whom we would haue this kingdom of thine to be aduanced, are farre ſhort in al ſuch graces as were meete for thoſe that ſhould bee vouchſafed that ſpeciall fauour. But neither is there any fleſh and bloud in thy ſight found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of any ſuch fauour: neither is it meete, that for our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, thy kingdome ſhould not bee aduanced on earth; in ſuch ſort as to thy glorie doth apperteyne, and may ſtand with thy pleaſure here on earth. And ſeeing that it pleaſed thee, in the face of thine annoynted to vouchſafe that fauour to <hi>David</hi> thy ſeruant, notwithſtanding that of himſelfe he was no better then any others, and notwithſtanding thoſe great infirmities of his that were found in him after his calling: wee humbly beſeech
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13150:52"/> thee, in thoſe thy mercies ſo to couer whatſoeuer corruption is in vs, as that for it thou ſuffer not the aduancement of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be hindred among vs. <hi>Iſrael</hi> (thou ſeeſt, for a great part of vs) is yet in bondage vnto thoſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> of ours, and by them kept vnder, in miſerable ſlauerie, and groſſe idolatrie: and, ſuch as thou haſt ſet vp among vs, to proceede and go forward with this our deliuerance, do (for the moſt part) ſo little remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that part of their duetie, that therein they do but very little: and many of them nothing at all. <hi>Saul</hi> did ſomewhat, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous well, in compariſon of many of ours: not only, when his kingdome was better confirmed (as agaynſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> alſo) but euen at his firſt enterance likewiſe, when as he was but newly come to his kingdome, and the ſame did hang but looſely vnto him as yet, as in that valiant expedition of his agaynſt the <hi>Ammonites</hi> at <hi>Iabeſh-Gilead.</hi> But the leſſe, O Lord, that they haue done, and are diſpoſed as yet to do: the more needfull is it for thée, to take ſome further order for it, both for the reliefe of thy diſtreſſed people, and for the aduancement of thy kingdome among vs. The leſſe likewiſe, that our meane and baſe eſtate here in this life, is capable of ſo great proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and glorie, as to thy kingdome of right apperteyneth, the more we deſire that it would pleaſe thee to haſten the time of the ſecond comming of our Lord and Sauiour, that he taking downe this Tabernacle on earth, may ſet vp thy pallace for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in heauen, and there aduaunce thy glorious kingdome euen to the full. The cauſe, O Father, wee knowe is thine; and wee are thine: and now hauing made our prayers to thee, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thee to heare the ſame, euen in the face of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, Ieſus Chriſt thy Sonne our Lord, to whom with thee and the holy Ghoſt be aſcribed al power, thanks, kingdome, and glorie, for euer and euer.

                  <hi>Pſalmes</hi> in order as they lye: and adde this further, not only that we neede none other, but alſo that we can not haue, as I do take it, ſo perfect a courſe any way elſe. And for thoſe that are diſpoſed to take that courſe, it is not amiſſe heere to ſet downe, what thoſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are, that do apperteine to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas of time, and to the matter that now we ſpeake of. Wherein becauſe there is ſome diuerſitie of opinion among the beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued authors, therefore I cannot promis to do it, but in ſuch ſort, as that ſome may take exception vnto it: as that, either there are mo, that might be referred vnto this place: or elſe, that ſome of thoſe that are taken in by me to that account, might better be ſpared. For though moſt of them be ſuch, as by the text it ſelfe, are plainly noted to appertein vnto that time: yet others again there are, that haue no ſuch euidencie in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet by good circumſtances are moſt likely to belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And thoſe that are of this ſort I take to be a ſixt part of the whole, or to the number of twenty and fiue: not that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the iudgement of any, that inclineth to another opinion, either on the one ſide, or on the other, but that I content my ſelfe to ſet downe,<note place="margin">Which are thoſe Pſalmes that David made in this time of his trouble. 4.7.11.26.34.35.42.43.52.54.55.56.57.58.59.60.63.84.94.109.116.120.131.140.141. In what caſe they may fit us beſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are drawne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certeyne principall heads.</note> what, by the ſearch that I haue made, I find to be the moſt likely. Which 25. alſo are theſe, the 4, the 7, the 11, the 26, the 34, and 35, the 42, and 43, the 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, the 60, and 63, the 84, the 94, the 109, the 116, the 120, the 131, the 140, and 141. But now becauſe that many of vs are not any thing neere in ſuch ſort exerciſed as <hi>David</hi> was, nor of ſo quick and nimble ſpirits to any good: therefore in that order and courſe that they lye, they do not ſo much affect many of vs, as otherwiſe they would, that lightly haue not any ſuch feeling, but only of ſome one or two ſpeciall matters, euery one as he findeth himſelfe to be more ſpecialy touched: or, if we haue feeling of mo beſides, yet becauſe we are not ſo thoroughly exerciſed therein, we are not able, in ſuch fort as thoſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> direct vs, ſo redily to go from one to another, but incline rather, either ſtill to abide in ſome one, for that one time of our prayers, or at leaſt not to depart from it vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by ſome ſuch maner of digreſſion, as might ſerue by little and little to draw our minds (as it were by degrées) from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13150:53"/> the ſame that we haue in hand, vnto that other with the which we ſhould fall: in. And yet is it good for vs to conſider, that in ſuch caſe we are not to thinke of our ſelues alone, but to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs the eſtate of all generally, and of euery member in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Which courſe if we take, then is there nothing in theſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of his, but ſuch as at all times doth fitly belong, either to our ſelues, or to ſome others that are members (with vs) of the miſticall bodie of Chriſt. But becauſe that many there are, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not take ſo perfect a courſe, for this cauſe haue I thought it worth the labour, to ſort ſuch things as we haue in thoſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> vnto certaine principall heads: that as thoſe that can redily go with <hi>David,</hi> and are ſo exerciſed, haue that courſe that is méeteſt for them in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> themſelues; ſo others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that are leſſe exerciſed, or not ſo redie, may haue wherein they may be fruitfully occupied, in any of thoſe points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>David</hi> at this time was exerciſed. And thoſe chiefe and principall points wherewith <hi>David</hi> was exerciſed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made thoſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What thoſe chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heads are, whereunto the effect of all thoſe Pſalmes may be reduced.</note> (as may appeare by the matter or ſubſtance of them) were generally but two. For either he conſidereth of the hard eſtate that by meanes of his enimies he was in: or elſe of the goodnes of God towards him. When he conſidereth of the hardnes of that eſtate that by meanes of his enimies he was in, ſometimes he doth but vnfold it, and ſometime he praieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. When he conſidereth of the goodnes of God towards him, ſometimes he is occupied, in declaring that truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he hath in God, notwithſtanding all his calamities and euils whatſoeuer, ſometime he promiſeth that he will be thankfull. And the better to declare what truſt and confidence he hath in God, notwithſtanding all his calamities and euils whatſoeuer, he doth both profeſſe the ſame vnto God, and ſo frameth his ſpeach vnto others withall, as that thereby alſo he doth plainly declare, that there was in him a notable confidence. Which his ſpeach vnto others reſteth in two principall points: one, that he vpbraideth the enemie, and as it were triumpheth ouer him; the other, that he comforteth the godly, and, being himſelfe in great diſtreſſe, neuertheleſſe he will be a comforter to others. So, if we marke, they all do make ſixe principall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13150:54"/> heads. For, either he vnfoldeth the eſtate he was in: or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt it: or ſheweth his confidence in God: or vpbraideth the enimie: or comforteth the godly: or is occupied in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing. Which, being ſixe may yéeld one to euery day in the weeke: and all to the Sabboth. The firſt alſo, and the laſt, do each of them yeeld a couple of <hi>Pſalmes:</hi> the ſecond, and third, each of them three: and the fourth, and the fift, are both but ſingle.
